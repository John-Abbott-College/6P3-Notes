## Analog to Digital Conversion

Considering the analog signal below. The signal is being sampled in a program at
2Hz (2 times/sec) with the help of an ADC that has 6-bit resolution. The ADC can
handle up to 8V signals.

A) What are the voltages being sampled by the ADC?

B) If the signal reached max voltage, what would be the integer number passed to
the program by the ADC?

## Virtual Env Exercises

The following exercises are meant for familiarization with `venv`.


1. Complete the following steps inside a virtual environment

    1. Create a virtual environment
    1. Install the following libraries:
        - [howdoi](https://pypi.org/project/howdoi/)
        - [pyjokes](https://pyjok.es/)
    1. List all pip packages to see the extra dependencies that got installed.
    1. Have some fun using both installed packages (see their docs).
    1. Export the dependency list to `requirements.txt` by using `pip freeze`.
    1. Deactivate the virt. env.
    1. Move `requirements.txt` to one folder level above the project folder (so it's not
        deleted in the next step).
    1. Delete the project folder.

1. Create a new project and virtual environment using the `requirements.txt` from the
    previous exercise.

    1. Create a new project folder with a virtual environment inside.
    1. Move `requirements.txt` inside the new project folder.
    1. Install project packages using `requirements.txt`
