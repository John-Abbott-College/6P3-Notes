### reTerminal from Seeed

![hardware platform used for the course: reTerminal](../assets/1-tech-stack-reterminal.png ":size=500")

- Open source hardware manufactured by Seeed Studios (Shenzhen, China)
- Built around the Raspberry Pi platform. Uses a Raspberry Pi
  [Compute Module 4 (CM4)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/compute-module-4/?variant=raspberry-pi-cm4001000)
- See the [official wiki page](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/reTerminal/) for
  specs and details.
- Runs the Linux based Raspberry PI Operating system

### Grove Connection System

![enter image description here](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/GroveSystem/images/starter_kit_main.jpg)

- A standard for wiring sensors to a connector.
- Eliminates the need for breadboards and complicated wiring.
- Supported communication protocols: Digital, Analog, UART and I2C.
- See [official wiki page](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove_System/) for
  details.

## Software

### Python

![pythonâ„¢](https://www.python.org/static/img/python-logo.png)

This course will be using **Python version 3.10** to:

- Run programs inside the Raspberry Pi (reTerminal) in order to read and control
  sensors.
- Communicate with the API of the Cloud Platform.

### VS Code IDE

Visual Studio Code IDE will be used with various extensions in order to:

- Program in Python (linting, intellisence, debugging, etc)
- Remotely connecting to the Respberry Pi.
- Connecting to Microsoft Azure.

### Linux (Raspberry Pi OS)

![Logo for raspberry pi os](../assets/1-tech-stack-raspberry-pi-os.png ":size=400")

The operating system running inside the reTerminal is Raspberry Pi OS.

- Linux Debian based.
- Requires basic use of BASH shell (eg. ssh, and environmental variables).

### Microsoft Azure

![Azure IoT Hub: Create Using Azure Portal | Build5Nines](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fi1.wp.com%2Fbuild5nines.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F12%2FAzure_IoT_Hub_Featured_Image.jpg%3Fresize%3D1080%252C675%26ssl%3D1&f=1&nofb=1 ":size=400")

Microsoft Azure will be used as the main platform that will:

- Register and connect devices.
- Store and analyse data.
- Manage the security layer.
- Provide libraries (SDKs) that can easily be integrated into our code.
- For more information see
  [Azure IoT page](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/iot/).
