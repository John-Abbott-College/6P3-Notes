The library that is used to implement a command line interface for bash is called the
[Readline library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Readline). While it comes with a set
of default keybindings (see the #keyboard-shortcuts section), it is possible to modify
these and other behaviors of the CLI interface by putting commands into a `.inputrc` file,
typically in the home directory.

The configuration options in `.inputrc` are particularly useful for customising the way
Tab-completion works, e.g. with the `ls` command

The inputrc variable syntax is simple:

```
set variable value
```

Below are a list of variables I find particularly useful, as well as a sample `.inputrc`
file showing how each of these are set.

- `bell-style`

    Controls what happens when Readline wants to ring the terminal bell. If set to ‘none’,
    Readline never rings the bell. If set to ‘visible’, Readline uses a visible bell if
    one is available. If set to ‘audible’ (the default), Readline attempts to ring the
    terminal’s bell.

- `completion-ignore-case`

    If set to ‘on’, Readline performs filename matching and completion in a case-insensitive
    fashion. The default value is ‘off’.

- `editing-mode`

    The editing-mode variable controls which default set of key bindings is used. By
    default, Readline starts up in Emacs editing mode, where the keystrokes are most
    similar to Emacs. This variable can be set to either ‘emacs’ or ‘vi’.

- `mark-symlinked-directories`

    If set to ‘on’, completed names which are symbolic links to directories have a slash
    appended (subject to the value of mark-directories). The default is ‘off’.

- `show-all-if-ambiguous`

    This alters the default behavior of the completion functions. If set to ‘on’, words
    which have more than one possible completion cause the matches to be listed
    immediately instead of ringing the bell. The default value is ‘off’.

A sample `~/.inputrc` file with these variables in use:

```bash {filename=~/.inputrc}
set bell-style none
set completion-ignore-case On
set editing-mode vi
set mark-symlinked-directories On
set show-all-if-ambiguous On
```

You can find many more configuration options in [@HowToBashStartup].
