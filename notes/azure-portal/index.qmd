## Getting started with Azure

These notes cover the basics for setting up your Azure account, and the main Azure
resource we will use in class, the
[IoT Hub](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/iot-hub/).

### Creating an account

If you have not already,
[create an Azure account using your student email](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/).

Otherwise, log in to your azure account at <https://portal.azure.com>

### Account cost overview

The Azure services we need for this course (creating an IoTHub Resource group and sending
messages) are **free** to use, *within a daily message limit (~8000)*.

This means that we need to take care to either use student credits, or ensure we have a
budget-warning system in place, to prevent incurring unnecessary costs.

Note that John Abbott students get $100 of credit for 12 months. After 12 months, or when
your student credit runs out, you have two options:

1. [upgrade your account to "pay-as-you-go"](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/education-hub/azure-dev-tools-teaching/program-faq#what-happens-after-i-use-my--100-credit-or-when-i-m-at-the-end-of-12-months-)
    - Pay-as-you-go is will still be free for our course, as long as you set up a
      [budget alert](#setting-budget-alerts) in case you exceed the free-usage-limits
1. [create a new non-student account](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2227353&clcid=0x409&l=en-us)
  using a non-student email address, comes with $200 credit

In the big picture, no matter what your situation is, your Azure plan should have the
following properties:

1. No **upfront** costs -- your account should be free to create, and every
   service/resource you create should be free to create.
1. No **monthly** costs -- your costs should be covered entirely by one of the following:

    1. your student account credit
    1. $200 free credit for
    1. pay-as-you-go that is **free per month**, but will charge your credit card **per
      usage** beyond the threshold of free tools.

1. A **budget alert system** that warns you when your usage exceeds >$5 . Even if you are in
   situation 2.3 (pay-as-you-go free services), you should not expect to pay more than a couple dollars. See the [Setting budget alerts](#setting-budget-alerts) section.

See the [FAQ](#faq) section if you have further questions.

## Managing your account

Below are some useful account management how-tos.

### Checking your balance

As you experiment with Azure you might want to know your current balance.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https//portal.azure.com)
1. Search for **Cost Management**
1. Select **Payment methods**
1. Check your **Azure credits** panel.

For more details, see
[Track Microsoft Customer Agreement Azure credit balance](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/mca-check-azure-credits-balance?tabs=portal#main)

### Setting budget alerts

It's possible to setup email alerts when your Azure spending exceeds a certain threshold.
This avoids unexpected spending of Azure credits.

1. In the Azure Portal Home, select the **_Resource groups_** service.
1. Select the resource group you want to monitor with a budget.
1. In the left panel, select **_Budgets_** under the _Cost Management_ group and select
   **_Add_**.
1. Give your budget a name and an amount.
1. Select the **percent spending** for the alert and the **email** to receive the
   notification.
1. Click **_Create_**.

## Using the tool

Below are some how-tos for services we will be using in this class.

### Documentation

The Azure resource we will be using the most, **IoT Hub**, has complete
documentation/how-to-guides/tutorials at <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/>.

![](assets/azure-docs-page.png)

Familiarize yourself with the left-hand menu, including the "Quickstarts" and "How-to guides".

### Creating an IoT Hub Resource

There are two ways to create resources in Azure:

- using the Azure portal website: <https://portal.azure.com>
- using [Azure CLI](/notes/azure-features/#azure-cli)

The Azure documentation typically has instructions for *both* methods in all their
tutorials -- you can select which method you want to choose by clicking the tabset button
for it:

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Azure Portal

[Create and manage Azure IoT Hubs using Azure Portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/create-hub?tabs=portal).

Note that each section has the "Azure Portal" option selected.

## Azure CLI

[Create and manage Azure IoT Hubs using Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/create-hub?tabs=cli).

Note that each section has an "Azure CLI" option selected.

:::

No matter which method you choose, you should make sure the resource you're making is **free** and in a nearby region.

Suggested choices for the following options:

- **Subscription**: Your active subscription (probably "Azure for Students")
- **Resource group**: Create ONE resource group for this class (any name is fine)
- **IoT hub name**: Recommended: yourname-iot-hub
- **Region**: Central US or East US or Canada East
- **Tier**: Free
- **Daily message limit**: 8,000 ($0/month)

You can keep the defaults for all subsequent menus (Networking, Management, Add-ons, Tags).

Once you're done creating your IoT Hub, it should appear in your Azure portal. See the figure below:

::: {#fig-sample-iot-hub}

![](assets/sample-resource-group-iot-hub.png)

In this figure, the **Resource Group** is named **6P3**, and a **IoT Hub Resource** named
**6P3-IoT-Hub** can be seen in the list of its resources. You can view your resource
groups on Azure Portal by clicking on the "Resource groups" menu item on the left.

## FAQ

> Q: I'm not eligible for a student account?

Student accounts last for 12 months -- if you have taken courses in the past that require
an Azure account, and it was more than 12 months since you created that account, your
student credits have unfortunately expired.

See [What happens after I use my $100 credit or when I'm at the end of 12 months? ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/education-hub/azure-dev-tools-teaching/program-faq#what-happens-after-i-use-my--100-credit-or-when-i-m-at-the-end-of-12-months-)

> Q: I'm not eligible for the $200 free account credit for my non-student account?

The $200 credit is only available if you have not used that email address for an Azure
account in the past (and it only lasts for one month).

If you are not eligible for the $200 credit on the email address you have provided, you
have two choices, both of which are fine:

- use a new email address
- register for a free-tier pay-as-you-go.

> Q: I tried to register for the pay-as-you-go and I'm told it costs $35 per month?

The pay-as-you-go account **should not cost any upfront or monthly charges**. Double check
that you do not select options like "tech support plans" or "standard-tier service" --
ALWAYS opt out of any paid options, ALWAYS select free-tier for any choices provided to
you by Azure.

> Q: if I'm on free-tier and there's no monthly costs, why do I need to monitor the
> budget?

The pay-as-you-go account may charge your credit card, only when you *use* the service
*beyond the defined free-tier limits*.

In our class, we will have IoT Hub services that handle communication between your Mobile
App from App Dev III, and your reTerminal devices from Connected Objects. **The free-tier
limit for the IoTHub is 8000 messages per day** -- I don't think there will be a reason to
exceed this, so by default, you may never have to pay any money for this service.

However, there may be small charges to your credit card, ONLY IF you exceed the free-tier
limits of the services we use. These charges will be small, but it is possible for them to
get out-of-hand by accident. To make sure they do not get out of hand by accident, you
must set up a Budget for your Resource Group to alert you when charges exceed a certain
number. [Please review the course notes about budgets and set up an alert if you have not
done so](#setting-budget-alerts).

> Q: I have some other question?

Please let me know if you have any questions, or if there's something else that doesn't
seem to work. I will update these instructions if there are more troubles you run into
that I can share answers for.
