## Platform as a Service (PaaS)

So far in this course, we have developed applications that are almost entirely
local to our reTerminal (production) and workstation (development) environments.

We did not worry ourselves about data storage, application logic,
authentication, etc. We could implement these things locally in Python,
but we can also automate many of them using a PaaS framework.

**Platform as a service (PaaS)** is a complete development and deployment
environment in the cloud:

- Infrastructure: servers, storage, and networking,
- Platforms: development tools, business intelligence services (BI), database
  management systems, and more.

It's really a reduced version of **Software as a service** (which you may be more familiar
with), allowing the flexibility to write customized application/device software while
benefitting from infrastructure and analysis services.

See the graphic below:

[SaaS vs PaaS vs IaaS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/introduction-iot-solution),
Microsoft.

:::

PaaS is designed to support the complete application life-cycle: building, testing,
deploying, managing, and updating -- while giving the developer flexibility to implement
the actual services themselves.

See more in
[What is PaaS (azure.microsoft.com)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-paas/)

## IoT Subsystems

We can breakdown an IoT solution into **subsystems** and explore how information
flows between them:

- **IoT Devices**: The physical devices and sensors where data originates.
- **Cloud Gateway**: The Cloud Gateway provides a cloud hub for secure
  connectivity, telemetry, event ingestion and device management (including
  command and control) capabilities.
- **Stream Processing**: Processes large streams of data records, evaluates
  rules for those streams, and further routes the data.
- **Storage**: Storage can be divided into warm path (data that is required to
  be available for reporting and visualization immediately from devices), and
  cold path (data that is stored longer term and used for batch processing).
- **User Interface and Reporting**: The user interface for an IoT application
  can be delivered on a wide array of device types, in native applications, and
  browsers.
- **Business Process Integration**: Facilitates executing actions based on
  insights garnered from device telemetry data during stream processing.
  Integration could include storage of informational messages, alarms, sending
  email or SMS, integration with CRM, and more.

We will use Microsoft Azure to manage each sub-system individually.

## Azure IoT Services

Azure offers many IoT-related services (see image below). In this course we'll only
explore a few.

## IoT Hub & IoT Central

Microsoft Azure has two service offers for deploying and managing IoT systems:
**IoT Hub** and **IoT Central**.

> The page
> [Overview: Connection options for Azure IoT device developers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-develop/concepts-overview-connection-options#application-platforms-iot-central-and-iot-hub)
> offers a great summary and comparison between IoT Hub and IoT Central.

### IoT Central

Azure IoT Central is a **software-as-a-service (SaaS)** application that provides a
complete platform for hosting IoT applications. Its main feature is a web UI
that streamlines the lifecycle of creating and managing IoT applications.

The web UI simplifies the tasks of creating applications, and connecting and
managing from a few up to millions of devices.

This service has a limited free plan (2 devices with 5000 messages per month).
Pricing available
[here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/iot-central/).

See
[official site for details](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/iot-central/#overview)
or watch the
[walk-through for an example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G32stXSwtyA).

> We will not use IoT Central in this course because we'll connect the
> underlying Azure services ourselves.

### IoT Hub

Azure IoT Hub is a **platform-as-a-service (PaaS)** application that also provides a
platform for hosting IoT applications. IoT Hub acts as a central message hub for
bi-directional communication between IoT applications and connected devices.

IoT Hub offers **greater control and customization** over your application
design, and **more developer tool options** for working with the service.
However, it requires more development time and slightly more management
complexity.

This service also offers a more generous free plan (500 devices with 8000
messages per day).

See
[official site for details](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/iot-hub/#overview)
and
[pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/iot-hub/#pricing).

> We will use IoT Hub in this course.

## Azure Resource Groups & Zones

To use Azure IoT Hub, we need to creaet Azure **resource groups**.

An Azure **resource group** is a "container" that holds related resources for an Azure
solution (such as an IoT Hub).

The resource group can include all or a subset of the resources for the
solution. You decide how to allocate resources to resource groups based on what
makes sense for your organization. Generally, group resources share the same
lifecycle (deploy, update, and delete).

### Azure Regions

Azure resources and their groups must be deployed to a particular **region**.

Azure operates in multiple datacenters around the world. These datacenters are
grouped in to **geographic regions**.

::: {#fig-azure-regions}

Azure infrastructure map. You can find a current list of all Azure regions at the
[Zzure geographies web tool](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/geographies/#overview).

[Map of Azure Regions](https://www.poppelgaard.com/citrix-xenapp-essentials-microsoft-azure/azure_datacenters),
Thomas Poppelgaard, 2017.

:::

Canada has two Azure regions:

- **Canada Central:** located in Toronto (with 3 zones).
- **Canada East**: located in Quebec City (no zones).

The US has a few nearby regions as well, in particular:

- **Central US**: allows the use of advanced IoT features still in testing.

## Azure IoT Dev Tools

Azure offers several developer tools to create, manage and connect to the IoT
Hub service. We'll be using two: the Azure Portal, and the Azure CLI.

There's also a few extensions worth noting.

### Azure Portal

The Azure Portal is a browser-based portal for IoT Hub and devices.

Documentation
: [Azure portal documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/)

Quick Start
: [What is the Azure portal?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/azure-portal-overview)

IoT Example
: [Create an IoT hub with Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-create-through-portal)

::: {#fig-azure-portal .column-margin}

![](assets/azure-portal-example.png)

The Azure Portal at <https://portal.azure.com> is a web app that can access and modify all of your
IoT Hub data/configurations/actions/etc.

:::

#### Metrics

One very useful feature of Azure Portal is the data analysis and presentation software that comes built-in.

Without any extra configuration, all IoT commands and actions are logged and stored on the Azure Portal, and
visualizations of data usage can be easily displayed for verification/debugging/analysis.

::: {#fig-azure-metrics .column-margin}

![](assets/azure-metrics.png)

An example of the Azure Metrics portal page. You can easily verify that the daily number of messages you're sending
is below the Free Tier limit of 8000 by checking this page when using your IoT Hub devices.

:::

To find the metrics page for a given **Azure resource**, do the following:

1. In the left navigation menu on the Azure portal, select **All Resources**.
1. Select the link on your IoT hub.
1. Select **Monitoring** in the left pane of your IoT Hub, and find the **Metrics** submenu.
1. In the **Scope** field, enter your IoT hub name.
1. In the **Metric Namespace field**, select IoT Hub Standard Metrics.
1. In the **Metric** field, select the desired metric.
1. Hover your mouse pointer over the chart to see detailed information at a given time.


### Azure CLI

**Azure CLI** is a terminal tool to manage Azure services offered as Bash and
PowerShell shells.

::: {.callout-warning}
An old version of this document recommended using the [official installation instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
Unfortunately, these methods (using `apt`) depend on unmaintained packages. Instead, install `azure-cli` in a python virtual environment as described below.
:::

Documentation
: [Azure CLI documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/)

Installation
: `azure-cli` is a python package we can install in a virtual environment:

```bash
# Create a venv if you do not have one already
$ python -m venv .venv
(.venv) $ source .venv/bin/activate
# Install dependencies and azure-cli
(.venv) $ pip install wheel # needed to build azure-cli
(.venv) $ pip install azure-cli
```

You can later add these packages to a `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` file for projects where you use these tools regularly.

::: {.callout-note}
If you're having issues installing this package via the above method, make sure your system `python` is up to date.
Revist the [course notes for installing developer environment dependencies](/notes/developer-environment/#install-dependencies),
and make sure your system packages and python libraries are up to date.
Then, delete your existing virtual environment and recreate it with the updated `python`.

IoT Example
: [Create an IoT hub with CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-create-using-cli)

#### Azure CLI IoT extension

Azure CLI has a variety of installable extensions to manage different Azure services.

The **Azure IoT extension** gives us access to the `az iot` subcommand -- a very
convenient CLI for controlling IoT-related sevices.
