## Internet of Things (IoT)

The **Internet of Things (IoT)** is comprised of equipment, machines, products,
and devices that are connected to the cloud and **periodically collect, send
and/or receive data.**

> **IoT** refers to the **entire network** of:
>
> - physical devices,
> - tools,
> - equipment, and
> - smart objects
>
> These objects have the capability to **collect and share data** about:
>
> - how they are used
> - the environment around them
>
> IoT devices can also **receive commands or updates** via the cloud.

## Why collect all this data?

By analyzing the data collected by these connected objects, users and
organisations can make informed decisions in near real-time and automate tightly
integrated processes. This avoids decision making based on limited or out-dated
data.

This data can create quick feedback loops for automation. Data from one object
can trigger actions or control several other objects with timing and precision
that could not be achieved by humans.

## IoT Examples

The use of IoT can be organised in two fields of application:

- **Industrial IoT (IIoT)**
- **Consumer IoT**

### Consumer IoT

Examples of consumer IoT are:

- **Home Security**: Sensors, alarms, cameras, lights, and microphones provide
  24/7 security and surveillance. All of which can be controlled from a smart
  phone.

- **Smart Home**: Smart lighting, heating and sound systems can be automated to
  detect human present or receive instructions remotely. Voice Assistants can
  also control house appliances or and provide information.

- **Wearables:** Smartwatches and fitness trackers can monitor blood pressure or
  heart rate, and physical activity and suggest workouts, breaks or medical
  assistance.

- **Appliances:** Smart fridges can keep track of food quantities and expiry
  dates and create shopping lists accordingly. Smart outlet plugs can measure
  electrical consumption and turn other appliances on/off.

### Industrial IoT (IIoT)

Most people tend to first think of IoT as consumer devices. However, **their
main value added happens in industrial applications.**

- **Equipment Maintenance:**
  [Rolls-Royceâ€™s Total Care](https://www.rolls-royce.com/media/press-releases/2016/11-07-2016-rr-takes-totalcare-digital-with-microsoft-and-singapore-airlines.aspx)
  provides a suite of predictive maintenance and repair services for its jet
  engines, including monitoring engine health, and modifying engines to increase
  reliability and durability.

- **Farming:** [John Deere](https://www.iotforall.com/ces-2021-john-deere) is
  building intelligence into its large tractors and sprayers through sensors
  that make the machines into mobile platforms capable of self-driving.

- **Heavy Machinery & Transportation:**
  [Rio Tinto](https://www.iotforall.com/iot-is-reshaping-heavy-industry), a
  global mining company uses a remote command center to orchestrate the actions
  of huge drills, excavators, trains, and trucks across multiple mining sites.

- **Renewable Energies:**
  [Iberdrola and Siemens](https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/features/iot-wind-power/)
  are using IoT to optimize the operation and maintenance of offshore wind power
  farms, the lifetime extension of wind turbines and the reducing the cost of
  energy.

- **Facilities Management:** Monitoring of buildings, infrastructure, and other
  spaces, allow to improve energy efficiency, space utilization, productivity,
  and safety. These insights may help:
  - save money by automating lighting or optimizing heating and cooling cycles.
  - Increase employee or occupant satisfaction by keep equipment running or
    ensuring that supplies are stocked.

## High-level Components of an IoT System

IoT systems are compromised of five high-level components:

1.  **Sensors**:

    - Collect data from the device's environment (eg. velocity, GPS coordinates,
      temperature, etc).
    - Sensors might use different communication protocols.

2.  **IoT Devices** are computing devices that have:

    - Ability to securely register with the cloud;
    - Connectivity options for sending and receiving data with the cloud.

3.  **Cloud Gateway / Hub**:

    - Securely ingests and sends data or commands to devices;
    - Offers device management (provisioning) services (add, remove, update,
      group, etc).

4.  **Data Processing:**

    - Data validation;
    - Integrate with **business processes** (check thresholds, send alerts,
      trigger action)
    - Place data in **Storage**;
    - Retrieve data from **Storage** for deeper / long-term analysis;

5.  **User Interface:**
    - Data visualization;
    - Trigger manual actions;
    - Configure automatic actions;
    - Facilitate device management.

## IoT Cloud Service Providers

Since IoT objects typically move around, connectivity and data collection need
to happen over wide geographical areas.

Most companies do not want to deal with setting-up the **physical infrastructure
and software** required to have this level of distributed connectivity and
reliability (servers, databases, backup systems, networking, container
orchestration, etc).

It is typically far more practical and cost-effective to use the services of an
established IoT Cloud Service Provider.

The three main Cloud Service Providers in the IoT space are:

- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**
- **Microsoft Azure**
- **Google Cloud**

There are many other Cloud providers such as
[IBM Cloud IoT](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/internet-of-things) and
[Oracle IoT](https://www.oracle.com/internet-of-things/).

> In this course we will focus on **Microsoft Azure**. However, all three
> platforms offer similar functionality.
