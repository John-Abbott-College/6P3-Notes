From the [course outline][course-outline]:

> This course will introduce students to the basic principles of the Internet of Things (IoT), a connected
network of objects sensing and exchanging data about the physical world. Students will learn to program
a micro-controller or single board computer to read data from sensors and control actuators. By the end
of the course, students will be able to build a stand-alone object that is securely connected to a cloud
service provider in order to collect and analyze telemetry data associated with multiple devices
