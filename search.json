    "section": "Particularly Useful Commands",
    "text": "Particularly Useful Commands\nThe Linux shell environment has literally hundreds of useful commands. I’ll try to highlight/explain a handful throughout the semester to help you get the sense of just how powerful these commands can be, when you get the hang of them.\n\ntar\nThis section adapted from www.gnu.org: Introduction to tar\nThe tar program provides the ability to create, extract, and otherwise manipulate archives of files, where an archive of files is simply a file that stores a collection of files.\nThe usecases for tar are very similar to zip, which you are likely more used to: tar is a program that helps facilitate efficient storage, transfer, and backup of collections of files, particularly large files, by providing an interface for collecting/compressing/extracting groups of files. You can read more about the usecases and history of tar at gnu.org\n\ntar Operations\nLike other Linux CLI programs, the behavior of tar can be altered by command line arguments, or parameters. Unlike most Linux CLI programs, tar has fundamentally different operations it performs depending on some of those parameters. The most common are:\n\n--create, -c: Create a new tar archive.\n--list, -t: List the contents of an archive.\n--extract, -x: Extract one or more members from an archive.\n\nFor example:\n\nCreateExtractList\n\n\n(env)jyourusername@yourhostname:~ $ which python\n# &lt;double check that the python executable comes from your venv&gt;\nWhen you create an archive, you must specify which files you want placed in the archive. If you do not specify any archive members, GNU tar will complain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWhen using --create or -c, it is very important to make sure there isn’t already a file in the working directory with the archive name you intend to use, or that you don’t care about its contents. Whenever you use ‘create’, tar will erase the current contents of the file named by --file=archive-name or -f archive-name if it exists. To add files to an existing archive, you need to use a different option, such as --append or -r\n\n\n\n\n(env)jyourusername@yourhostname:~ $ which python\n# &lt;double check that the python executable comes from your venv&gt;\n\n\n(env)jyourusername@yourhostname:~ $ sudo su\n(env)root@yourhostname:~ # which python\n# &lt;you should see that the python executable is in a different place!, even though we still have \"env\"&gt;\n\n\n\nEach of these operations is mutually exclusive, which makes some sense. You cannot create and extract an archive at the same time, that doesn’t make sense!\n\n\ntar Options\n\n--gzip, -z: Specify that the tar command should use gzip during the operation (either to compress or decompress, depending on the operation).\n--verbose, -v: Specify that the tar command should show the files being worked on as tar is running.\n--file=archive-name, -f archive-name: Specify the name of the .tar archive file that should be created/extracted/listed.\n\n\n\nTLDR; Examples\nTo make sense of the commands, it is better to have actual files/directories to work with. Of course the tar command is not limited to this set-up, but for the examples below assume at that we have a directory ~/practise, containing the files blues, folk, and jazz, and that ~/practise is your current working directory.\nThat is, assume you have a structure like this:\n$ pwd\n~/practise\n$ tree .\n.\n├── blues\n├── folk\n└── jazz\nTo place the files ‘blues’, ‘folk’, and ‘jazz’ into an archive named ‘collection.tar’, and to ensure the results are printed to the terminal, use any of the following commands\n$ tar --create --verbose --file=collection.tar blues folk jazz\n$ tar -cvf collection.tar blues folk jazz\n$ tar -cvf collection.tar ./*\nTo store practice’ in the new archive file ‘music.tar’, type:\n$ cd ..\n$ tar --create --verbose --file=music.tar practice\n$ tar -cvf music.tar practice\n# tries to creates an archive file called \"v\" containing collection.tar, blues, folk, jazz; succeeds if collection.tar already exists, errors out if it does not.\n$ tar -cfv collection.tar blues folk jazz",

    "text": "Virtual Environments\nThis section shows the use the python virtual environments (virt. envs.) with the venv build-in tool.\nvenv is the officially recommended way to manage virt. envs. but it’s not the only one. Other tools such as Conda, Pipenv, Poetry and PDM are other options.\n\nShort guide by python.org - Installing packages using pip and virtual environments\nDetailed guide by RealPython.com - Python Virtual Environments: A Primer \n\n\nWhy Virtual Environments?\nPython is not good at dependency management. We want to avoid:\n\nAvoid system pollution\n\nInstalling packages to the OS’s global Python will mix them with OS relevant packages. This could have unexpected side effects on OS tasks.\nBecause of the reason above, updating OS packages might overwrite or delete global Python packages.\n\nAvoid project dependency conflicts\n\nPython projects might require different versions the same external library.\n\nMaking projects reproducible in other environments.\n\nSince all dependencies are isolated to a specific project, it is easier to identify and document them.\nOnce the dependencies are “locked”, the project depency can be easily reproduced in other environments.\n\n\n\n\nVirtual Dependency Steps\nCreating and using virtual environments involved the following steps:\n\nCreation\nActivation\nInstalling dependencies\nDeactivation\nLocking dependencies\n\n\n\nCreating\n\nCreate a new folder for the project (if one doesn’t already exist).\ncd into the folder and create a new virt. env.:\n\n$ python3 -m venv my-env\nNote that my-env is the name of your virtual environment. venv is a popular choice.\n\n\nActivate & Deactivate\nOnce created, the virt. env. needs to be activated.\n# Linux\n$ source my-env/bin/activate\n\n# Windows\n$ my-env/Scripts/activate.bat\n\nNote: You can work with virtual environments without activating it. To do this, provide the full path to its Python interpreter when executing a command.\nTypically, you’ll want to activate the virtual environment to avoid repeatedly having to type long paths.\n\nTo deactivate:\n# Notice the shell prompt indicates a virt. env. is active\n$ (my-env) deactivate\n\n\nInstalling Packages with pip\nOnce a virtual environment is active, packages installed with pip will be local to that virtual environment.\nBy default, project packages are installed in:\nproject-folder\n    |- &lt;project-venv&gt;\n    |       |- lib\n    |           |- python3.X\n    |                   |- site-packages \nFor example, installing aiohttp:\n# Notice the shell prompt indicates a virt. env. is active\n$ (my-env) pip install aiohttp\n\n\nUsing requirements.txt\nProject dependencies can be listed in a file for portability. By convention, the file requirements.txt contains all the dependencies of a project created with a virtual environment.\n\nThis is analogous to package.json for Node.Js projects\n\nTo generate a requirements.txt for an existing project:\n$ pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt\nTo install packages from a requirements.txt:\n$ pip install -r requirements.txt\n\n\nMoving Virtual Environments\nIf you move a project that uses virtual environments to a different folder, you must re-initialize the virtual environment.\nFrom the official docs:\n\nScripts installed in environments contain the absolute paths to their environment’s interpreters.\n\nBecause of this, environments are inherently non-portable. You should always have a simple means of recreating an environment (for example, have a requirements file requirements.txt, and invoke pip install -r requirements.txt.\n\n\n\n\nVirtual Env Exercises\nThe following exercises are meant for familiarization with venv.\n\nCompare packages installed with pip inside and outside of a new virtual environment (virt. env.):\n\nList all globally installed pip packages: pip list\nCreate a new folder and use venv to create a virtual environment inside.\nActivate the new virt. env..\nList the pip packages as seen from inside the active virtual environment.\nDeactivate the new virtual environment.\n\nComplete the following steps inside the virtual environment (virt. env.) you created in the previous question.\n\nActivate the virt. env.\ninstall the following libraries:\n\nhowdoi\npyjokes\n\nList all pip packages to see the extra dependencies that got installed.\nHave some fun using both installed packages (see their docs).\nExport the dependency list to requirements.txt by using pip freeze.\nDeactivate the virt. env.\nMove requirements.txt to one folder level above the project folder (so it’s not deleted in the next step).\nDelete the project folder.\n\nCreate a new project and virtual environment using the requirements.txt from the previous exercise.\n\nCreate a new project folder with a virtual environment inside.\nMove requirements.txt inside the new project folder.\nInstall project packages using requirements.txt",

Use ls -al to list the files in this directory:\nusername@hostname:/sys/class/leds/usr_led0 $ ls -al\ntotal 0            \ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root    0 Jan 25 20:33 .               \ndrwxr-xr-x 8 root root    0 Jan 25 20:33 ..                                                                                                                                                                         \n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4096 Jan 26 22:02 brightness                                                                                                                                                                 \n\n\n\nUnix Permissions cheatsheet by Julia Evans\n\n\nThe brightness file inide the usr_led0 controls the brightness of LED0. But, because only root has write permissions to this file, we will likely run into permissions errors if we try to edit the value directly:\n$ nano /sys/class/leds/usr_led0/brightness\nPermission denied\n\n$ echo 255 &gt; /sys/class/leds/usr_led0/brightness\nPermission denied\n\n$ sudo echo 255 &gt; /sys/class/leds/usr_led0/brightness\nPermission denied\nThere are a few possible approaches to this problem:\n\nUse sudo + text-editor\nYou can open a text-editor with root permissions using sudo:\n# nano text editor\nsudo nano /sys/class/leds/usr_led0/brightness\n\n# or, you can use vi/vim text editor\nsudo vi /sys/class/leds/usr_led0/brightness\nEdit the brightness file to a value between 0-255 using the editor. When you save, you should see the change immediately.\n\n\nUse sudo + su\nUsing an editor is perfectly reasonable for a one-off change, but annoying if you want to make the change more often.\nWe can use the echo value &gt; /path/to/file pattern, but only if we have permissions to write to /path/to/file – we can obtain these permissions if we run the entire command as the root user.\n\nNOTE: Running commands as the root user can have unintended consequences, ranging from annoying/tedious to fix, to completely devastating/permanently ruinous for your machine. You should avoid being root wherever possible (see Use sudo + tee section below for how to avoid it for this problem).\n\nYou can enter a root shell instance using the command su (switch user), or by using sudo -i or sudo -s:\nuser@hostname $ sudo su\nroot@hostname # \n\nuser@hostname $ sudo -i\nroot@hostname # \n\nuser@hostname $ sudo -s\nroot@hostname # \nYour shell should now display root@hostname:~#.\nTurn on the LED with maximum brightness\n# echo 255 &gt; brightness\nTurn off the LED\n# echo 0 &gt; brightness\nSimilarly, you can control usr_led1 and usr_led2 and even the buzzer on /sys/class/leds/usr_buzzer\nWhen done working as root, you can exit the root shell and return to your user shell using the exit command (or Ctrl-D as a hotkey):\nroot@hostname # exit\nuser@hostname $\n\n\nUse sudo + tee\nIf we want to avoid using a text editor, AND avoid logging into a root shell instance, it would be great if something like this worked:\n$ sudo echo 255 &gt; /sys/class/leds/usr_led0/brightness\nBut it doesn’t! Can you understand why? Consider which part of the instruction sudo applies to. Unfortunately, there is no way to sudo &gt; or sudo filename since sudo executes commands as the root user, NOT filenames/redirects.\nWhat if there were a command that we could put after the redirect, and sudo that command? What would that command need to do? It’s time to introduce a “new” command: tee.\nTo be clear, tee is a 50 year old program and an absolute classic – it is as ubiquitous/essential as the other OG unix programs like ls, cat, echo. We will see why in the following example.\nTry running man tee in your reTerminal. You should see something like the following:\nTEE(1)\n\nNAME\n       tee - read from standard input and write to standard output and files\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       tee [OPTION]... [FILE]...\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       Copy standard input to each FILE, and also to standard output.\nWe have here a command that will read from standard input, and write that same content from standard input into BOTH standard output AND files – the files we can specify as arguments.\nChallenge for Lab 2: where would you put tee and sudo in the command below, to fix our permissions problems?\n$ echo 255 | /sys/class/leds/usr-led0/brightness \n# this command is missing `tee` and `sudo`.... find where to put them, and you've learned a very important unix pattern!\n\n\nLuminosity Sensor\nThe digital light sensor can read the surrounding light levels.\n\nEnter the following directory\n\ncd /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device0\n\nRead the following file to obtain the light intensity value in Lux\n\ncat in_illuminance_input \nOutput:\npi@raspberrypi:/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device0 $ cat in_illuminance_input \n2719\nNote: We don’t need to be root to read this file. Its permissions are set to let all users read it, even-though it belongs to the root user:\nrw-r--r-- 1 root root 4096 Jan 30 22:16 in_illuminance_input",

This opposition to motion is more properly called resistance.\nThe amount of current in a circuit depends on the amount of voltage and the amount of resistance in the circuit to oppose current flow.\n\nJust like voltage, resistance is a quantity relative between two points.\nVoltage and resistance are often stated as being “between” or “across” two points in a circuit.\n\nBelow are the two symbols used for a resistor:\n\n\n\nWhat is resistor",

    "text": "Voltage Drop Across Components\nConsider the circuit below:\n\n\nWe must select the resistor value in order to maximize the life of the LED.\nThe following requirements apply:\n\nThe ideal current across the LED is of 20mA.\nThe voltage drop across the LED (Vled) is of 2.2V.\nThe voltage source is 12V.\n\nUsing Ohm’s law:\nR1 = Vr / Ir (Vr and Ir are the voltage and current across the resistor)\nHow do we find Vr and Ir?\nNote that because there is a LED that is also “consuming” some voltage, R1 is no longer the same as V1.\n\nThe total voltage drop across all components of the circuit must equal the source voltage.\nThis is know as Kirchhoff’s Law\n\nThis means that the voltage dropped at the LED and the resistor must add up to the same value as the source voltage.\nV1 = Vled + Vr\nVled was provided as a design constraint: Vled = 2.2V. Therefore we can easily calculate Vr:\nVr = V1 - Vled = 12V - 2.2V = 9.8V\nIt’s possible to measure the voltage drop across the resistor by using a multimeter that measures the voltage difference before and after the resistor.\n\nNotice how the multimeter is not interrupting the circuit. It is rather “sampling” the circuit at two points.\n\n\n\nNow that we know the voltage drop across the resistor, we are only missing the current flowing through it (Ir)\n\nBecause the circuit only has a single path, the current leaving the source is the same as the current flowing through all components.\n\nSince we are optimizing for the LED lifespan, the target current is 20mA or 0.02A.\nWe now have all necessary information to calculate the resistance value:\nR1 = Vr / Ir = 9.8V / 0.02A = 490Ω",

I will keep it maintained throughout the rest of the semester.\nAnnouncements: Announcements like this one will be posted on the course website and (sort-of) automatically posted on Moodle as well. If you like RSS, you can subcribe using the  icon in the nav bar.\nLecture index: I’ve fixed some metadata and theming issues for the Topics page (also called Lectures). Here you can find an index of every course lecture, and sort them by category. This should help keep track of topics and things learned.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions, or if there’s something that doesn’t seem to work.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Analog: the natural world\nWe live in an analog world. Most of the naturally occurring events that we experience happen in an analog form.\n\nAnalog signals varies continuously in time and amplitude.\nThis means that changes happen over a range of values with infinite “in between” steps.\n\nFor example, the following events have an infinite number of transitions. It only depends on how accurately you can track them:\n\nThe colors in a rainbow.\nThe position of a swinging pendulum.\nThe exact time of the day.\n\n\nTemperature\nThe A/C and heating systems in a house are typically activated once the temperature reaches some minimum and maximum values.\nThe chart below is tracking the temperature in a room as the A/C and heating systems are activated over a few days.\n\n\n Temperature changes over time   Adapted from poster: Analog and Digital Signals by Digikey.\n\nLet’s say the maximum temperature reached in the room is 30C and the minimum temperature is 15C. A person in the room would have observed every possible temperature in between that range (15.01, 15.0101, 15.0102, 15.01021, etc).\nThe change in temperature produces analog information since it is changing over an infinite range of values.\n\n\nSound\nSound is also an example of an analog signal.\nWhen a volume of air is displaced quickly, air molecules are compressed against each other creating a high-pressure region. The high pressure region expands and compresses the air in the neighbouring area. Sound can travel thanks to this “chain effect”.\n\nBy observing how the air pressure changes over time, we can draw a sound wave.\nThis is how speakers and microphones interact with air to generate sound.\n\n\n\n\nAnimation of acoustic wave travelling in air\n\n\n\n Sound waves travelling through air   - Waves and Acoustics Animations by isvr.\n\nSound waves are also an example of an analog signal because the amplitude of the wave transitions through the entire range of possible values between the Min and Max.\n\n\nAnalog Signals Graphs\nA signal varies over time. It’s helpful to plot it on a graph where time is plotted on the horizontal, x-axis, and the value being tracked on the vertical, y-axis.\nLooking at a graph of a signal is usually the easiest way to identify if it’s analog or digital.\n\nWhen dealing with electricity we track voltage levels (amplitude).\nA time-versus-voltage graph of an analog signal should be smooth and continuous.\n\n\n\n\nAnalog Sine Wave\n\n\nWhile these signals may be limited to a range of maximum and minimum values, there are still an infinite number of possible values within that range.\nFor example, the analog voltage coming out of your wall socket oscillates between -120V and +120V. As you increase the resolution more and more, you discover an infinite number of values that the signal can actually be (64.4V, 64.42V, 64.424V, and other increasingly precise values).",

This is also called bit resolution (see Sampling below).\nFor example, if a data point can only use one bit of definition, then it can only track on/off states, resulting in the red square wave seen above.\nHowever, if a data point can use 8 bits to store a value, then it can represent a value ranging from 0 to 255 (see the green sinusoidal voltage wave above).",

    "text": "Sampling\nSampling is the process of inspecting the value of an analog signal at regular time intervals.\nWhen an ADC is sampling an analog signal, there are two variables that will characterize the digital output:\n\nSampling rate.\nBit resolution.\n\n\nMusic sampling Some music genres like rap and hip-hop commonly sample song segments from other artists to play in the background.\n\nThe term sampling is used because traditionally song segments were extracted from vinyl records which produce analog sound and saved in digital formats.\n\n\n\n\n\nSampling rate\nThe time between samples is the sample period (T, in seconds), and the number of samples taken per second is the sample frequency or sample rate (fs, in samples/second or Hz).\nBasically, sampling is taking snap-shot values of the analog signal at regular time intervals.\n\n\n\nAnalog signal showing sample period and sample frequency\n\n\n\n Sample period and fequency for an electric signal   - US Naval Academy.\n\nSampling period examples:\n\nIf a signal is sampled every half second (0.5s sampling period, T), the sample frequency (f*) is 1/0.5s = 2 Hz (times per second).\nIf the sample frequency (f) is 2000 Hz, the sampling period (T) is = 1/2000Hz = 0.0005 secs (0.5 milliseconds).\n\nThe higher the sample rate, the more accurate the digital signal is.\n\n\n\nSignals of increasing sample rate\n\n\n\n Same signal sampled with different sample rates   - US Naval Academy.\n\n\n\nEncoding & Bit resolution\nEncoding is the process of mapping the sampled analog signal value to discrete binary numbers (digital information).\n\nADC devices are characterized by the number of bits available to represent a signal.\n\nFor example, consider an electrical signal that ranges from -1 volts to to +1 volts and must be converted to a 3 bit number.\n\n\nEncoding Procedure\nTo approximate the numeric conversion from a voltage signal to a digital output, follow the steps below:\n\nIdentify the minimum and maximum voltage values that can be observed in the input.\n\nExample: -1 to +1 volts (2 volt range)\n\nIdentify the minimum and maximum binary values that can generated as the output. Note the amount of unique numbers represented by this range\n\nExample: For a 3-bit number: 000 (decimal 0) is the minimum and 111 (decimal 7) is the maximum, making a total of 8 unique numbers.\n\nDivide the voltage range that will be observed (max voltage - min voltage) by the amount of unique binary numbers available. This will determine the voltage increment that each binary number represents.\n\nExample: (+1V - (-1V)) / 8 = 2V/8 = 0.25V\n\nLayout each binary number and their increments and read where the voltage values lie.\n\nAssuming the ADC has a resolution of 3 bits, all voltage values (-1V to 1V) must be represented with at most 3 bits, or 2^3 = 8 unique values (0 is a unique value).\n\n\n\nvoltage signal converted to a bit resolution of 3 bits\n\n\n\n Voltage signal between -1V and 1V converted to digital with a 3 bit resolution   - US Naval Academy.\n\nIn this case: - 000 is assigned to the voltages from -0.75 V to -1.0 V, - 001 is assigned to the voltages from -0.5 V to -0.749 V, - 010 is assigned to the voltages from -0.25 V to -0.49 V, - and so on.\nThe binary representation of the above signal is:\n110 101 100 011 011 100 110 110 100 010 000 000 001\nIf the sampling is happening 2000 times per second (Hz) and for every sample we generate 3 bits, we are generating 2000 x 3 bits = 6000 bits/sec of information. This is also know as the bitrate.\nIf a song of 3 minutes is sampled with the same specs, how big will this file be in kB?\nWhat is the bitrate of music on Spotify?\n\n\nSensor voltages & bit resolution\nIoT systems typically work with electrical signals encoded in voltage levels.\nEvery hardware that converts from analog to digital (and vice-versa) needs to have an appropriate ACD device.\nMicrocontrollers are often used to process these signals because they often have an integrated ACD and they are very inexpensive.",

    "text": "Passing Script Arguments\nIt’s possible to pass command line arguments to a Python script directly from your shell:\n$ python myscript.py first 2 True\nThe arguments passed are first, 2 and True .\n\nsys.argv\nThe Python sys module provides access to these arguments via sys.argv:\n\nsys.argv is a Python list of arguments.\n\n# myscript.py\n\nprint(f'Argument List: {sys.argv}')\nOutput:\n$ python myscript.py first 2 True\n\nArgument List: ['myscript.py', 'first', '2', 'True']\nNotice the following:\n\nThe first element in the list is the name of the script.\nArguments are available as strings.\n\nUnfortunately, we can’t trust that the user will always pass arguments in the correct order and using appropriate data types. We would still need to parse the arguments and make sure they are valid.\nFortunately, there is a built-in module that can help us do that.\n\n\nargparse\nargparse is a built-in module that makes it easy to write user-friendly command-line interfaces.\nOnce the script defines what arguments are required, argparse will figure out how to parse those out of sys.argv. The argparse module also automatically generates help and usage messages, and issues errors when users give the program invalid arguments.\n\nFor a basic tutorial of argparse, see this page.\n\nIn its simplest form, argparse must be imported and a parser must be instantiated:\n# myscript.py\n\nimport argparse\nparser = argparse.ArgumentParser()\nargs = parser.parse_args()\nprint(args)\nHowever, this will generate an error because we must tell argparse what argument flags and what data types to parse.\n$ python myscript.py first 2 True\n\nusage: myscript.py [-h]\nmyscript.py: error: unrecognized arguments: first 2 True\nTo “teach” argparse how to parse an argument we use the command parser.add_argument()\n# myscript.py\nimport argparse\nparser = argparse.ArgumentParser()\n\nparser.add_argument(\"word\", type=str)\nparser.add_argument(\"number\", type=int)\nparser.add_argument(\"toggle\", type=bool)\n\nargs = parser.parse_args()\n\nprint(args)\nprint(args.word)\nprint(args.number)\nprint(args.toggle)\n$ python myscript.py first 2 True\n\nNamespace(word='first', number=2, toggle=True)\nfirst\n2\nTrue\nNotice how in the example above, all arguments were positional, which makes them mandatory. In other words, the order in which they are passed determines which variable they were being assigned to.\nIt’s also possible to make arguments optional. In this case, they must be specified with the correct “Flag”.\n# myscript.py\nimport argparse\nparser = argparse.ArgumentParser()\n\nparser.add_argument(\"--word\", type=str)\nparser.add_argument(\"--number\", type=int)\nparser.add_argument(\"--toggle\", type=bool)\n\nargs = parser.parse_args()\n\nprint(args)\nprint(args.word)\nprint(args.number)\nprint(args.toggle)\n$ python myscript.py --word first --number 2\n\nNamespace(word='first', number=2, toggle=None)\nfirst\n2\nNone\n\n\nargparse References\n\nArticle 10 tips for passing arguments to Python script",

Interfering with the system Python installation can cause problems for your operating system, so it’s important that if you install third-party Python libraries, you use the correct package-management tools.\nThere are two routes to installing libraries into the default python distribution. You can use apt and install pre-configured system packages, or you can use pip to install packages which are not distributed as part of Raspberry Pi OS.",

    "text": "Installing Python packages using apt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nInstalling packages using apt is the preferred method for installing Python libraries under Raspberry Pi OS.\n\n\nPackages installed via apt are tested, are usually pre-compiled so they install faster, and are designed for Raspberry Pi OS. They won’t break your system. Installing via this route also means that all required dependencies are also installed, and a log of installation is maintained by the OS so installation can be easily rolled back (libraries can be uninstalled) if needed.\nYou can see a complete list of Python apps maintained by Debian developers on the stable repositories here. Many, but not all, popular open-source Python packages are maintained for Debian by professionals and hobbyists alike.\nTo see an example: you may find yourself wanting to install the Python 3 library to support the Raspberry Pi BuildHAT component. To install this using `apt1, you would:\n$ sudo apt install python3-build-hat\n…​to install the pre-built library.\nIf you want to install a Python library called \"foobar\" you can useapt search foobar to find the exact package name – partial search matches are supported, so you don’t need to know the whole name in advance. Very useful!\nUsing apt makes installing larger packages, like numpy (which has many native dependencies including a Fortran compiler), much simpler and more predictable than installing individual packages using Python’s own package-management system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn apt, Python packages have a consistent naming scheme: you’ll find that the a given package “foobar” is going to be called python-foobar or python3-foobar in the apt repositories – this helps distinguish python packages from other packages on a debian system.",

    "text": "Installing python packages using Pip\nThe goal of operating systems like Debian is to be stable, that is, unlikely to crash due to a poorly tested/implemented program. That does come at a cost of not always offering the latest versions of packages, nor having a complelely comprehensive set of the bleeding edge packages that are available.\nMany developer depend on packages that are under active development. And, there are many packages that there are no Debian maintainers for. For cases like these (and many other cases, as we’ll see) it is useful for programming languages like Python to have an independent packaging manager.\nFor python, the most commonly used package manager is pip.\n\nPip installs packages from the Python Package Index repository (pypi.org) rather than the Debian or any other package repositories.\n\nEven though Raspberry Pi OS comes with pip installed, we can’t just use it right away, as we we’ll see in the next section.\n\nAbout Python virtual environments\nIn previous versions of the operating system, it was possible to install libraries directly, system-wide, using the package installer for Python, pip. You’ll find the following sort of command in many tutorials online – including in our Labs.\n$ pip install buildhat\nIn newer versions of Raspberry Pi OS, and most other operating systems, this is disallowed. If you try and install a Python package system-wide you’ll receive an error similar to this:\n$ pip install buildhat\nerror: externally-managed-environment\n\n× This environment is externally managed\n╰─&gt; To install Python packages system-wide, try apt install\n  python3-xyz, where xyz is the package you are trying to\n  install.\n\n  If you wish to install a non-Debian-packaged Python package,\n  create a virtual environment using python3 -m venv path/to/venv.\n  Then use path/to/venv/bin/python and path/to/venv/bin/pip. Make\n  sure you have python3-full installed.\n\n  For more information visit http://rptl.io/venv\n\nnote: If you believe this is a mistake, please contact your Python installation or OS distribution provider. You can override this, at the risk of breaking your Python installation or OS, by passing --break-system-packages.\nhint: See PEP 668 for the detailed specification.\nThis error is generated because you’re trying to install a third-party package into the system Python. A long-standing practical problem for Python users has been conflicts between OS package managers like apt and Python-specific package management tools like pip. These conflicts include both Python-level API incompatibilities and conflicts over file ownership.\nTherefore from Debian Bookworm onwards, packages installed via pip must be installed into a Python virtual environment using venv. A virtual environment is a container where you can safely install third-party modules so they won’t interfere with, or break, your system Python.\n\n\nUsing pip with virtual environments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny packages that cannot be installed using apt should instead installed onto a Python Virtual Environment using venv and pip.\n\n\n\nTo use a virtual environment you will need to create a container to store the environment. There are several ways you can do this depending on how you want to work with Python.\n\n\nUsing a separate environment for each project\nOne way you can proceed is to create a new virtual environment for each Python project you make. Here, you’ll create a directory to hold your own code along with a virtual environment directory:\n$ mkdir my_project\n$ cd my_project\n$ python -m venv env\nIf you now look inside the my_project directory you’ll see a directory called env.\n$ ls -la\ntotal 12\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 pi pi 4096 Oct  3 14:34 .\ndrwx------ 20 pi pi 4096 Oct  3 14:34 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x  5 pi pi 4096 Oct  3 14:34 env\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nVery important for Lab2:\nIf you want to inherit the currently installed packages from the system Python, you should create your virtual environment using python -m venv --system-site-packages env.\nThis will include the important Raspberry PI python modules that come with RaspberryPi OS in your venv.\n\n\nInside this directory is a full Python distribution. How do we use it?\nA nice feature of venvs is that they must be activated to be used. This allows you to maintained several different venvs all over your machines to maintain many different projects with different versions of python.\nTo activate your virtual environment and make that version of Python the one you’re currently using, you should type:\n$ source env/bin/activate\n(env) $\nYou’ll see that your prompt is now prepended with (env) to indicate that you’re no longer using the system Python. Instead, you’re using the version of Python contained inside your virtual environment. Any changes you make here won’t cause problems for your system Python; nor will any new modules you install into your environment.\n(env) $ which python\n/home/username/my_project/env/bin/python\nIf you install a third-party package, it’ll install into the Python distribution in your virtual environment:\n(env) $ pip install buildhat\nLooking in indexes: https://pypi.org/simple, https://www.piwheels.org/simple\nCollecting buildhat\n  Downloading https://www.piwheels.org/simple/buildhat/buildhat-0.5.12-py3-none-any.whl (57 kB)\n     ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 57.8/57.8 kB 2.8 MB/s eta 0:00:00\nCollecting gpiozero\n  Downloading https://www.piwheels.org/simple/gpiozero/gpiozero-2.0-py3-none-any.whl (150 kB)\n     ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 150.5/150.5 kB 6.9 MB/s eta 0:00:00\nCollecting pyserial\n  Downloading https://www.piwheels.org/simple/pyserial/pyserial-3.5-py2.py3-none-any.whl (90 kB)\n     ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 90.6/90.6 kB 7.5 MB/s eta 0:00:00\nCollecting colorzero\n  Downloading https://www.piwheels.org/simple/colorzero/colorzero-2.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl (26 kB)\nRequirement already satisfied: setuptools in ./env/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from colorzero-&gt;gpiozero-&gt;buildhat) (66.1.1)\nInstalling collected packages: pyserial, colorzero, gpiozero, buildhat\nSuccessfully installed buildhat-0.5.12 colorzero-2.0 gpiozero-2.0 pyserial-3.5\n(env) $\nNow, if you pip list, you’ll see that your current version of Python includes your new modules.\n(env) $ pip list\nPackage    Version\n---------- -------\nbuildhat   0.5.12\ncolorzero  2.0\ngpiozero   2.0\npip        23.0.1\npyserial   3.5\nsetuptools 66.1.1\nAfter writing your code, you can run it from the command line inside the virtual environment as you’d expect, by invoking Python as usual.\n(env) $ ls -la\ntotal 12\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 pi pi 4096 Oct  3 14:34 .\ndrwx------ 20 pi pi 4096 Oct  3 14:34 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x  5 pi pi 4096 Oct  3 14:34 env\n-rw-r--r--  1 pi pi    0 Oct  3 14:45 my_code.py\n(env) $ python my_code.py\nHello World!\n(env) $\nYou can leave your virtual environment and return to using the system Python by typing:\n(env) $ deactivate\n$\n…​and demonstrate to yourself you’ve done so by checking the installed packages using pip list.\n\n\nIncluding system packages in your venv\nThis section has been adapted directly from realPython.com: Virtual Environments: Include the System Site-Packages. The whole article is worth skimming for reference.\nIn this class, we will often use the RaspberryPi python packages that we install system-wide (gpio, RPi, etc), and we may want to access them in the same environment where we create local virtual environments.\nThat is, while you still want to keep your projects in separate environments, you can save the effort of re-installing gpio or RPi into each of these projects.\nYou can access all modules you’ve installed to your base Python’s site-packages directory by adding the --system-site-packages flag when creating your virtual environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: If you install any additional external packages, then Python will put them into the site-packages directory of your virtual environment. You only get read access to the system site-packages directory.\n\n\n\nCreate a new virtual environment while passing this argument. You’ll see that in addition to your local site-packages directory, the path to your base Python’s site-packages directory will stick around in sys.path.\nTo test this, you can create and activate a new virtual environment using the --system-site-packages argument:\n$ python3 -m venv env --system-site-packages\n$ source venv/bin/activate\n(venv) $\nOnce again, you’ve created a new virtual environment named venv, but this time you passed the --system-site-packages argument. Adding this optional argument resulted in a different setting in your venv/pyvenv.cfg file:\n$ cat env/pyvenv.cfg\nhome = /usr/bin\ninclude-system-site-packages = true\nversion = 3.11\nBy default, the include-system-site-packages is set to false.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is common to forget to include the --system-site-packages flag when creating a venv. If you create a virtual environment and forget to include system site packages, you can include them again by changing include-system-site-packages in your environment env/pyvenv.cfg to true in your venv.\n\n\n\nThis change means that you’ll see an additional entry to sys.path, which allows the Python interpreter in your virtual environment to also access the system site-packages directory. Make sure your virtual environment is active, then start the Python interpreter to check the path variables:\n(env) $ python\n&gt;&gt;&gt; import sys\n&gt;&gt;&gt; from pprint import pp\n&gt;&gt;&gt; pp(sys.path)\n['',\n '/usr/local/lib/python311.zip',\n  'etc.'\n]\n\n\nUsing packages that require root permissions\nThe venv pattern is very useful for maintaining packages that do not require root permissions. This is a feature, not a bug – that way, you can have many developers independently install packages on one machine without needing to give them root permissions.\nSometimes (and particularly, in this couse) the packages we install require root permissions to work. Consider the packages that edit LED /sys/ files, like seeed-python-reterminal we install in Lab 2. We will run into an issue if we try to use these packages as normal users:\n(env) user@hostname:~/lab2/python $ python ./leds.py\n# ... output redacted\n&lt;Permissions error&gt;\nIt is unfortunately not fixable by simply using sudo:\n(env) user@hostname:~/lab2/python $ sudo python ./leds.py\n# ... output redacted\n&lt;Module seeed-python-terminal not included/available&gt;\nWhy isn’t the package available? Well, sudo runs python as the root user. The root user does not have your venv of python in its path. Try the commands below on your system to see if you understand what I mean.\n\nnormal usersudo user\n\n\n(env)jyourusername@yourhostname:~ $ which python\n# &lt;double check that the python executable comes from your venv&gt;\n\n\n(env)jyourusername@yourhostname:~ $ sudo su\n(env)root@yourhostname:~ # which python\n# &lt;you should see that the python executable is in a different place!, even though we still have \"env\"&gt;\n\n\n\nHow to resolve this problem? It is similar to the sudo echo &gt; file problem we saw with Bash. We need to make sure sudo is applying to the correct python executable. There are a few ways we can do this, all of which will look something like this:\n(env)jyourusername@yourhostname:~ $ sudo /absolute/path/to/venv/python ./leds.py\n(env)jyourusername@yourhostname:~ $ sudo ./env/relative/path/to/venv/python ./leds.py\n(env)jyourusername@yourhostname:~ $ sudo $(shell command for finding where python is installed) ./leds.py # use command substitution\nTry a few of these options out (will not work if you copy paste! Make sure you understand the commands)\n\n\nUsing a separate environment for each user\nAn alternative method to creating a virtual environment for each of your Python projects is to create a single virtual environment for your user account, and then activate that environment before running any of your Python code. This approach may be preferred if you commonly install the same set of modules for each project, and don’t want to have to bother creating individual Python environments for each project, essentially just duplicating your environment.\n$ python -m venv ~/.env\n$ source ~/.env/bin/activate\n(.env) $\nYou can check again that you’re in a separate environment by using pip list:\n(.env) $ pip list\nPackage    Version\n---------- -------\npip        23.0.1\nsetuptools 66.1.1\n…​and leave it using deactivate.\n(.env) $ deactivate\n$\n\n\nCheck library location\nCheck the location of where the module was installed with pip show &lt;module-name&gt;:\n(env) pi@raspberrypi:~ $ pip show seeed-python-reterminal\n\nName: seeed-python-reterminal\nVersion: 0.2\nSummary: seeed-python-reterminal\nHome-page: https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Seeed_Python_ReTerminal\nAuthor: Takashi Matsuoka (matsujirushi)\nAuthor-email: matsujirushi@live.jp\nLicense: MIT License\nLocation: /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages      # Library location\nRequires: evdev\nRequired-by: \nThe library is installed at: Location: /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages",

    "text": "Asynch with asyncio\nThe library asyncio enables code to be run concurrently: - Tasks share the execution thread while appearing to be executing in parallel.\n\nAsyncio API: - Coroutines and Tasks (good intro to asyncio).\nIn-depth guide: - Async IO in Python: A Complete Walkthrough by realpython.com.\nVideo Summary: - How To Easily Do Asynchronous Programming With Asyncio by ArjanCodes\n\n\nConcurrent vs Parallel\nIt’s important to note that concurrent code does not necessarily mean parallel.\n\nConcurrent does necessarily mean parallel execution. By Ten thousand meters\n\nIn Python, the only way to run parallel code is to use multiple CPU cores by running multiple Python interpreters that interact. See multiprocessing module.\n\nAsyncio is used to run multiple tasks or multiple threads concurrently but never at the same time (in parallel).\n\n\nSynchronous vs Async Execution\nIn typical programming, most tasks and processes are synchronous, meaning, they run one at the time, always waiting for the previous taks to finish\nSynchronous is disadvantageous when there are many tasks that need to wait for external input or output before it can proceed. For example:\n\nThe code was asked to sleep.\nWaiting for a HTTP response.\nWaiting for a Database call.\nWaiting to write to a file.\n\n\n\nSynchronous code execution by RealPython.com\nAsynchronous execution enables the execution of the next task while waiting for the external input/output.\n\nAsynchronous code execution by RealPython.com\n\nNote that the amount CPU processing (blue area in the diagrams above) is the same in both sync and async executions.\nHowever, the async execution spends less time waiting idle.\n\n\n\nAsyncio vs Threads\nBy default, asyncio works with task, not threads. However, it is possible to create new threads with asyncio.\n\nThreads\nOnce a thread is created, it is managed by the Operating System (OS).\nThread execution can be halted and resumed whenever the OS deems necessary, without any control from the application side.\n\nIn Python all threads run in the same CPU core due to the GIL (Global Interpreter Lock)\n\nThis type of time-slicing (execution time given for each thread) is called preemptive multitasking.\n\nPreemptive because the OS is anticipating the start and stop of each thread.\n\n\nThread execution time being managed by the OS. By Digikey.com\n\n\nAsyncio Tasks\nAsyncio uses cooperative multitasking to manage and share the CPU processing time (time-slicing).\n\nIn cooperative multitasking, each task must explicitly yield (or pass) execution time back to the main loop so that the next task can start/continue.\n\n\nTasks yielding CPU execution time so that other tasks can run. By Digikey.com\n\nIn Asyncio, tasks yield by using the await keyword.\n\n\nTasks yielding execution time with the await keyword. By Adafruit.com\nIn the image above, Task 1 (running function f()) yields execution time to Task 2 (running function g()) by using the await keyboard and vice-versa.\n\n\n\nCoroutines, Tasks & Event Loop\nIn Asyncio, there are 3 types of awaitable objects: - Coroutines - Tasks - Futures\n\nCoroutines\nCoroutines are functions that are awaitable.\nThey must be declared with the async keyword\nasync def countdown(task_name, seconds):\n    for i in range(seconds, 0, -1):\n        print(task_name, i)\n        await asyncio.sleep(1)\n    print(\"done!\")\n\n\nasync def main():\n    await countdown(\"simple count\", 4)\n\nasyncio.run(main())\n\n\"\"\" Output\nsimple count 4\nsimple count 3\nsimple count 2\nsimple count 1\ndone!\n\"\"\"\nIn the example above, countdown(), asyncio.sleep() and main() are coroutines.\ncountdown() and asyncio.sleep() were called with await , however, main() was called with asyncio.run()\n\nIn asyncio, all awaitable objects must run inside an event loop.\n\nThe method asyncio.run() creates a “top-level” event loop\n\n\n\n\nTasks\nTasks are used to schedule coroutines concurrently.\nOnce a task is scheduled, it will run as soon as the event loop is available.\n\nTasks are scheduled (wrapped) with asyncio.create_task()\nIn order to run a task to completion, it must be awaited.\n\nasync def main():\n    # Scheduling and starting tasks\n    taskA = asyncio.create_task(countdown(\"task A\", 3))\n    taskB = asyncio.create_task(countdown(\"task B\", 2))\n\n    # Doing something else while they run\n    await asyncio.sleep(1)\n    print(\"Everything, everywhere, all at once\")\n\n    # Awaiting for tasks to complete before ending main()\n    # Try running this code without awaiting\n    await taskA\n    await taskB\n\nasyncio.run(main())\n\n\"\"\" Output\ntask A 3\ntask B 2\nEverything, everywhere, all at once\ntask A 2\ntask B 1\ntask A 1\ndone!\ndone!\n\"\"\"\nThe scheduling and execution of each task is illustrated in the diagram below: \nOrder of task execution. From Qiita.com\nInstead of creating Tasks and awaiting them individually, it’s possible to run multiple coroutines concurrently and wait for all of them:\nasync def main():\n    # Running and awaiting multiple coroutines\n\n    await asyncio.gather(\n        countdown(\"task A\", 4),\n        countdown(\"task B\", 3)\n    )\n\n    await asyncio.sleep(1)\n    print(\"Everything, everywhere, all at once\")\n\n\nasyncio.run(main())\n\"\"\"\ntask A 4\ntask B 3\ntask A 3\ntask B 2\ntask A 2\ntask B 1\ntask A 1\ndone!\ndone!\nEverything, everywhere, all at once\n\"\"\"\n\n\nFutures\nA Future in Asyncio is the equivalent of a Promise in JavaScript.\n\nIt is rare that developers need to use a Future directly.\n\n\n\n\nDiving Further & References\nThe following are excellent resources for learning more about Asyncio:\n\nAsync IO in Python: A Complete Walkthrough by RealPython.com\n\n\n\nAsyncio Exercises\n\nCreate a program with asyncio that uses two function to display information “at the same time”. Call the functions with arguments of your choice.\n\ncountdown():\n\nTake it from the examples above.\n\nblink():\n\nArguments:\n\nA message that will be displayed periodically. Defaults to “Blink”\nThe number of seconds to flash the message.\nHow many times per second the message should be flashed.\n\nReturn:\n\nThe number of times the message was flashed.\n\nExample:\n\ncalling blink(\"Hello\", 5, 2) should return 10\n\n\n\nUse the library requests to fetch 5 random pokemon names from the Pokemon API.\n\nUse a random number between 1 and 251 as the pokemon id.\nUse the API endpoint: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{id or name}/.\nUse the requests built-in json decoder: JSON Response Content\nSend 5 GET requests.\nFor each request, display the name of the randomly selected pokemon.\nTime the total script execution with time.perf_counter()\n\nUse the library aiohttp to fetch 5 “simultaneous” random pokemon names from the Pokemon API.\n\nUse a random number between 1 and 251 as the pokemon id.\nUse the API endpoint: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{id or name}/.\nUse the aiohttp built-in json decoder: JSON Response Content\nSend 5 get requests at the same time using asyncio\nFor each request, display the name of the randomly selected pokemon.\nTime the total script execution with time.perf_counter()",

It’s worth knowing in a bit more detail how they work.\nNote: Online, you will often see apt-get used instead of apt. apt is a newer package manager API meant to replace the older API apt-get. However, they both do more or less the same things the same ways, and apt is a backwards compatible replacement for apt-get in all cases. See Debian docs for details.\nDuring Lab 1, you updated, upgraded and installed some packages in the Raspberry Pi OS using apt:\n\napt: the difference between update and upgrade\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommand\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nsudo apt update\nUpdate list of available packages\n\n\nsudo apt upgrade\nUpgrade the system by installing/upgrading packages\n\n\n\nCombined, these two commands update and upgrade all of the currently operating system packages on your system:\n$ sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nImportant: see the March 14 announcement about upgrading your Pi if at any point a system update causes hardware issues (e.g. your screen stops working)\n\n\nThere are a few other apt commands worth knowing.\n\napt: a variety of other commands I find myself using now and again\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommand\nDescription\nExample use case\n\n\n\n\napt list\nlist packages installed on your system based on package names.\napt list | grep \"package name\" Need to remember or check if you successfully installed an app? Combine apt list with grep and a pipe.\n\n\napt search &lt;query&gt;\nReturns all repository packages search in package descriptions\napt search \"package name\" Do you know part of the? Run after apt\n\n\napt show &lt;package&gt;\nshow package details\n\n\n\napt install &lt;package&gt;\ninstall packages\n\n\n\napt reinstall &lt;package&gt;\nreinstall packages\n\n\n\napt remove &lt;package&gt;\nremove packages\n\n\n\n\nYou can see details about all of these commands and more by running apt --help. Note: documentation will often leave out sudo since the need to run sudo depends on the machine and the user.\n\nIn general, commands that read data (apt list, apt search, etc.) will generally not require sudo, since most folderst that apt will touch are universally readable.\napt commands that write data (apt install, etc.) to a folder not owned by the current user – which is most folders outside of /home/username, but particularly common package install locations like /usr, /bin, etc. – these commands will require sudo to gain the required write permission\n\n\n\nApt source repositories explained\nThis section has been adapted directly from the Debian documentation: see SourcesList\nApt downloads packages from one or more software repositories (sources) and installs them onto your computer.\nA repository is generally a network server, such as the official DebianStable repository. Local directories or CD/DVD are also accepted.\nThe specific repositories (package sources) configured on your machine affect: - What software packages are available for download - What versions of packages are available - Who packages the software\n\nCommonly used package sources\n\nDebianStable: official Debian repository for the current release\nStableProposedUpdates: official Debian repository for upcoming point releases (security and important bug fixes every ~2 months)\nStableUpdates: official Debian repository for changes that cannot wait for the next point release, packages are also added to StableProposedUpdates for inclusion in the next point release\nDebianSecurity: official Debian repository for frequent security updates\nDebianBackports: more recent versions of some packages, compatible with DebianStable.\nDebianUnstable: rolling development version containing the latest packages\nDebianExperimental: development version containing the experimental/alpha/beta/untested packages\n\n\n\nEditing Software Sources\nBeing able to change the repositories used by your package management system is a powerful feature but this power comes with some responsibility.\nUsers are cautioned that it is possible to break your system (in a way that could be difficult or impossible to cleanly fix) by adding third-party repositories, or repositories for a Debian version that does not match your current version - these repository create a risk of conflicting package versions, creating what’s sometimes called a “Franken-Debian” system.\nThe whole concept behind a Debian stable release is that the Debian developers have picked a set of software and their versions that function nicely together. While this software is patched to fix security issues, the software is frequently not the latest version. It takes some experience to know how the repos may be changed without risk of breaking your system. Users of all levels are advised to change repos cautiously.",
