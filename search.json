All of which can be controlled from a smart phone.\nSmart Home: Smart lighting, heating and sound systems can be automated to detect human present or receive instructions remotely. Voice Assistants can also control house appliances or and provide information.\nWearables: Smartwatches and fitness trackers can monitor blood pressure or heart rate, and physical activity and suggest workouts, breaks or medical assistance.\nAppliances: Smart fridges can keep track of food quantities and expiry dates and create shopping lists accordingly. Smart outlet plugs can measure electrical consumption and turn other appliances on/off.\n\nIndustrial IoT (IIoT)\nMost people tend to first think of IoT as consumer devices. However, their main value added happens in industrial applications.\n\n\nHow Industrial Internet of Things are impacting our lives by Bluechip Infocorp Pvt Ltd via Medium.\n\nIndustrial IoT Examples:\n\nEquipment Maintenance: Rolls-Royce’s Total Care provides a suite of predictive maintenance and repair services for its jet engines, including monitoring engine health, and modifying engines to increase reliability and durability.\nFarming: John Deere is building intelligence into its large tractors and sprayers through sensors that make the machines into mobile platforms capable of self-driving.\nHeavy Machinery & Transportation: Rio Tinto, a global mining company uses a remote command center to orchestrate the actions of huge drills, excavators, trains, and trucks across multiple mining sites.\nRenewable Energies: Iberdrola and Siemens are using IoT to optimize the operation and maintenance of offshore wind power farms, the lifetime extension of wind turbines and the reducing the cost of energy.\nFacilities Management: Monitoring of buildings, infrastructure, and other spaces, allow to improve energy efficiency, space utilization, productivity, and safety.

    "text": "Programmable Sensors\nThis section is based on the official documentation for the reTerminal: Hardware and Interfaces Usage\n\nIn Linux, everything is a file stream that can be read and/or written to.\n\nFor example, keyboard inputs and communication over web-sockets are all read as a file streams.\nThe reTerminal has 3 programmable LED’s and a light sensor that can be controlled like a regular file.\n\nYou can see, there are 3 programmable LEDs in the reTerminal:\n\nSTA light can be turned on as red or green.\nUSR light can only be turned on as green.\n\n\nThe lights can be controlled at the OS level by editing files in the /sys/class/leds/ directory. Use ls -al to list the files in this directory:\nusername@hostname:/sys/class/leds/usr_led0 $ ls -al\ntotal 0            \ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root    0 Jan 25 20:33 .               \ndrwxr-xr-x 8 root root    0 Jan 25 20:33 ..                                                                                                                                                                         \n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4096 Jan 26 22:02 brightness                                                                                                                                                                 \n\n\n\nUnix Permissions cheatsheet by Julia Evans\n\n\nThe brightness file inide the usr_led0 controls the brightness of LED0. But, because only root has write permissions to this file, we will likely run into permissions errors if we try to edit the value directly:\n$ nano /sys/class/leds/usr_led0/brightness\nPermission denied\n\n$ echo 255 &gt; /sys/class/leds/usr_led0/brightness\nPermission denied\n\n$ sudo echo 255 &gt; /sys/class/leds/usr_led0/brightness\nPermission denied\nThere are a few possible approaches to this problem:\nUse sudo + text-editor\nYou can open a text-editor with root permissions using sudo:\n# nano text editor\nsudo nano /sys/class/leds/usr_led0/brightness\n\n# or, you can use vi/vim text editor\nsudo vi /sys/class/leds/usr_led0/brightness\nEdit the brightness file to a value between 0-255 using the editor.

    "text": "Analog: the natural world\nWe live in an analog world. Most of the naturally occurring events that we experience happen in an analog form.\n\nAnalog signals varies continuously in time and amplitude.\nThis means that changes happen over a range of values with infinite “in between” steps.\n\nFor example, the following events have an infinite number of transitions. It only depends on how accurately you can track them:\n\nThe colors in a rainbow.\nThe position of a swinging pendulum.\nThe exact time of the day.\n\nTemperature\nThe A/C and heating systems in a house are typically activated once the temperature reaches some minimum and maximum values.\nThe chart below is tracking the temperature in a room as the A/C and heating systems are activated over a few days.\n\n\n Temperature changes over time   Adapted from poster: Analog and Digital Signals by Digikey.\n\nLet’s say the maximum temperature reached in the room is 30C and the minimum temperature is 15C. A person in the room would have observed every possible temperature in between that range (15.01, 15.0101, 15.0102, 15.01021, etc).\nThe change in temperature produces analog information since it is changing over an infinite range of values.\nSound\nSound is also an example of an analog signal.\nWhen a volume of air is displaced quickly, air molecules are compressed against each other creating a high-pressure region. The high pressure region expands and compresses the air in the neighbouring area. Sound can travel thanks to this “chain effect”.\n\nBy observing how the air pressure changes over time, we can draw a sound wave.\nThis is how speakers and microphones interact with air to generate sound.\n\n\n\n\nAnimation of acoustic wave travelling in air\n\n\n\n Sound waves travelling through air   - Waves and Acoustics Animations by isvr.\n\nSound waves are also an example of an analog signal because the amplitude of the wave transitions through the entire range of possible values between the Min and Max.\nAnalog Signals Graphs\nA signal varies over time. It’s helpful to plot it on a graph where time is plotted on the horizontal, x-axis, and the value being tracked on the vertical, y-axis.\nLooking at a graph of a signal is usually the easiest way to identify if it’s analog or digital.\n\nWhen dealing with electricity we track voltage levels (amplitude).\nA time-versus-voltage graph of an analog signal should be smooth and continuous.\n\n\n\n\nAnalog Sine Wave\n\n\nWhile these signals may be limited to a range of maximum and minimum values, there are still an infinite number of possible values within that range.\nFor example, the analog voltage coming out of your wall socket oscillates between -120V and +120V. As you increase the resolution more and more, you discover an infinite number of values that the signal can actually be (64.4V, 64.42V, 64.424V, and other increasingly precise values)."

Note the amount of unique numbers represented by this range\n\nExample: For a 3-bit number: 000 (decimal 0) is the minimum and 111 (decimal 7) is the maximum, making a total of 8 unique numbers.\n\nDivide the voltage range that will be observed (max voltage - min voltage) by the amount of unique binary numbers available. This will determine the voltage increment that each binary number represents.\n\nExample: (+1V - (-1V)) / 8 = 2V/8 = 0.25V\n\nLayout each binary number and their increments and read where the voltage values lie.\n\nAssuming the ADC has a resolution of 3 bits, all voltage values (-1V to 1V) must be represented with at most 3 bits, or 2^3 = 8 unique values (0 is a unique value).\n\n\n\nvoltage signal converted to a bit resolution of 3 bits\n\n\n\n Voltage signal between -1V and 1V converted to digital with a 3 bit resolution   - US Naval Academy.\n\nIn this case: - 000 is assigned to the voltages from -0.75 V to -1.0 V, - 001 is assigned to the voltages from -0.5 V to -0.749 V, - 010 is assigned to the voltages from -0.25 V to -0.49 V, - and so on.\nThe binary representation of the above signal is:\n110 101 100 011 011 100 110 110 100 010 000 000 001\nIf the sampling is happening 2000 times per second (Hz) and for every sample we generate 3 bits, we are generating 2000 x 3 bits = 6000 bits/sec of information. This is also know as the bitrate.\nIf a song of 3 minutes is sampled with the same specs, how big will this file be in kB?\nWhat is the bitrate of music on Spotify?\nSensor voltages & bit resolution\nIoT systems typically work with electrical signals encoded in voltage levels.\nEvery hardware that converts from analog to digital (and vice-versa) needs to have an appropriate ACD device.\nMicrocontrollers are often used to process these signals because they often have an integrated ACD and they are very inexpensive."

This will determine the voltage increment that each binary number represents.\n\nExample: (+1V - (-1V)) / 8 = 2V/8 = 0.25V\n\nLayout each binary number and their increments and read where the voltage values lie.\n\nAssuming the ADC has a resolution of 3 bits, all voltage values (-1V to 1V) must be represented with at most 3 bits, or 2^3 = 8 unique values (0 is a unique value).\n\n\n\nvoltage signal converted to a bit resolution of 3 bits\n\n\n\n Voltage signal between -1V and 1V converted to digital with a 3 bit resolution   - US Naval Academy.\n\nIn this case: - 000 is assigned to the voltages from -0.75 V to -1.0 V, - 001 is assigned to the voltages from -0.5 V to -0.749 V, - 010 is assigned to the voltages from -0.25 V to -0.49 V, - and so on.\nThe binary representation of the above signal is:\n110 101 100 011 011 100 110 110 100 010 000 000 001\nIf the sampling is happening 2000 times per second (Hz) and for every sample we generate 3 bits, we are generating 2000 x 3 bits = 6000 bits/sec of information. This is also know as the bitrate.\nIf a song of 3 minutes is sampled with the same specs, how big will this file be in kB?\nWhat is the bitrate of music on Spotify?\n\n\nSensor voltages & bit resolution\nIoT systems typically work with electrical signals encoded in voltage levels.\nEvery hardware that converts from analog to digital (and vice-versa) needs to have an appropriate ACD device.\nMicrocontrollers are often used to process these signals because they often have an integrated ACD and they are very inexpensive.",

    "text": "Installing python packages using Pip\nThe goal of operating systems like Debian is to be stable, that is, unlikely to crash due to a poorly tested/implemented program. That does come at a cost of not always offering the latest versions of packages, nor having a complelely comprehensive set of the bleeding edge packages that are available.\nMany developer depend on packages that are under active development. And, there are many packages that there are no Debian maintainers for. For cases like these (and many other cases, as we’ll see) it is useful for programming languages like Python to have an independent packaging manager.\nFor python, the most commonly used package manager is pip.\n\nPip installs packages from the Python Package Index repository (pypi.org) rather than the Debian or any other package repositories.\n\nEven though Raspberry Pi OS comes with pip installed, we can’t just use it right away, as we we’ll see in the next section.\nAbout Python virtual environments\nIn previous versions of the operating system, it was possible to install libraries directly, system-wide, using the package installer for Python, pip. You’ll find the following sort of command in many tutorials online – including in our Labs.\n$ pip install buildhat\nIn newer versions of Raspberry Pi OS, and most other operating systems, this is disallowed. If you try and install a Python package system-wide you’ll receive an error similar to this:\n$ pip install buildhat\nerror: externally-managed-environment\n\n× This environment is externally managed\n╰─&gt; To install Python packages system-wide, try apt install\n  python3-xyz, where xyz is the package you are trying to\n  install.\n\n  If you wish to install a non-Debian-packaged Python package,\n  create a virtual environment using python3 -m venv path/to/venv.\n  Then use path/to/venv/bin/python and path/to/venv/bin/pip. Make\n  sure you have python3-full installed.\n\n  For more information visit http://rptl.io/venv\n\nnote: If you believe this is a mistake, please contact your Python installation or OS distribution provider. You can override this, at the risk of breaking your Python installation or OS, by passing --break-system-packages.\nhint: See PEP 668 for the detailed specification.\nThis error is generated because you’re trying to install a third-party package into the system Python. A long-standing practical problem for Python users has been conflicts between OS package managers like apt and Python-specific package management tools like pip. These conflicts include both Python-level API incompatibilities and conflicts over file ownership.\nTherefore from Debian Bookworm onwards, packages installed via pip must be installed into a Python virtual environment using venv. A virtual environment is a container where you can safely install third-party modules so they won’t interfere with, or break, your system Python.\nUsing pip with virtual environments\n\n\n\nAny packages that cannot be installed using apt should instead installed onto a Python Virtual Environment using venv and pip.\n\n\n\nTo use a virtual environment you will need to create a container to store the environment. There are several ways you can do this depending on how you want to work with Python.\nUsing a separate environment for each project\nOne way you can proceed is to create a new virtual environment for each Python project you make. Here, you’ll create a directory to hold your own code along with a virtual environment directory:\n$ mkdir my_project\n$ cd my_project\n$ python -m venv env\nIf you now look inside the my_project directory you’ll see a directory called env.\n$ ls -la\ntotal 12\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 pi pi 4096 Oct  3 14:34 .\ndrwx------ 20 pi pi 4096 Oct  3 14:34 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x  5 pi pi 4096 Oct  3 14:34 env\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\nVery important for Lab2:\nIf you want to inherit the currently installed packages from the system Python, you should create your virtual environment using python -m venv --system-site-packages env.\nThis will include the important Raspberry PI python modules that come with RaspberryPi OS in your venv.\n\n\n\nInside this directory is a full Python distribution. How do we use it?\nA nice feature of venvs is that they must be activated to be used. This allows you to maintained several different venvs all over your machines to maintain many different projects with different versions of python.\nTo activate your virtual environment and make that version of Python the one you’re currently using, you should type:\n$ source env/bin/activate\n(env) $\nYou’ll see that your prompt is now prepended with (env) to indicate that you’re no longer using the system Python. Instead, you’re using the version of Python contained inside your virtual environment. Any changes you make here won’t cause problems for your system Python; nor will any new modules you install into your environment.\n(env) $ which python\n/home/username/my_project/env/bin/python\nIf you install a third-party package, it’ll install into the Python distribution in your virtual environment:\n(env) $ pip install buildhat\nLooking in indexes: https://pypi.org/simple, https://www.piwheels.org/simple\nCollecting buildhat\n  Downloading https://www.piwheels.org/simple/buildhat/buildhat-0.5.12-py3-none-any.whl (57 kB)\n     ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 57.8/57.8 kB 2.8 MB/s eta 0:00:00\nCollecting gpiozero\n  Downloading https://www.piwheels.org/simple/gpiozero/gpiozero-2.0-py3-none-any.whl (150 kB)\n     ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 150.5/150.5 kB 6.9 MB/s eta 0:00:00\nCollecting pyserial\n  Downloading https://www.piwheels.org/simple/pyserial/pyserial-3.5-py2.py3-none-any.whl (90 kB)\n     ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 90.6/90.6 kB 7.5 MB/s eta 0:00:00\nCollecting colorzero\n  Downloading https://www.piwheels.org/simple/colorzero/colorzero-2.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl (26 kB)\nRequirement already satisfied: setuptools in ./env/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from colorzero-&gt;gpiozero-&gt;buildhat) (66.1.1)\nInstalling collected packages: pyserial, colorzero, gpiozero, buildhat\nSuccessfully installed buildhat-0.5.12 colorzero-2.0 gpiozero-2.0 pyserial-3.5\n(env) $\nNow, if you pip list, you’ll see that your current version of Python includes your new modules.\n(env) $ pip list\nPackage    Version\n---------- -------\nbuildhat   0.5.12\ncolorzero  2.0\ngpiozero   2.0\npip        23.0.1\npyserial   3.5\nsetuptools 66.1.1\nAfter writing your code, you can run it from the command line inside the virtual environment as you’d expect, by invoking Python as usual.\n(env) $ ls -la\ntotal 12\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 pi pi 4096 Oct  3 14:34 .\ndrwx------ 20 pi pi 4096 Oct  3 14:34 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x  5 pi pi 4096 Oct  3 14:34 env\n-rw-r--r--  1 pi pi    0 Oct  3 14:45 my_code.py\n(env) $ python my_code.py\nHello World!\n(env) $\nYou can leave your virtual environment and return to using the system Python by typing:\n(env) $ deactivate\n$\n…​and demonstrate to yourself you’ve done so by checking the installed packages using pip list.\nIncluding system packages in your venv\nThis section has been adapted directly from realPython.com: Virtual Environments: Include the System Site-Packages. The whole article is worth skimming for reference.\nIn this class, we will often use the RaspberryPi python packages that we install system-wide (gpio, RPi, etc), and we may want to access them in the same environment where we create local virtual environments.\nThat is, while you still want to keep your projects in separate environments, you can save the effort of re-installing gpio or RPi into each of these projects.\nYou can access all modules you’ve installed to your base Python’s site-packages directory by adding the --system-site-packages flag when creating your virtual environment.\n\n\n\nNote: If you install any additional external packages, then Python will put them into the site-packages directory of your virtual environment. You only get read access to the system site-packages directory.\n\n\n\nCreate a new virtual environment while passing this argument. You’ll see that in addition to your local site-packages directory, the path to your base Python’s site-packages directory will stick around in sys.path.\nTo test this, you can create and activate a new virtual environment using the --system-site-packages argument:\n$ python3 -m venv env --system-site-packages\n$ source venv/bin/activate\n(venv) $\nOnce again, you’ve created a new virtual environment named venv, but this time you passed the --system-site-packages argument. Adding this optional argument resulted in a different setting in your venv/pyvenv.cfg file:\n$ cat env/pyvenv.cfg\nhome = /usr/bin\ninclude-system-site-packages = true\nversion = 3.11\nBy default, the include-system-site-packages is set to false.\n\n\n\nIt is common to forget to include the --system-site-packages flag when creating a venv. If you create a virtual environment and forget to include system site packages, you can include them again by changing include-system-site-packages in your environment env/pyvenv.cfg to true in your venv.\n\n\n\nThis change means that you’ll see an additional entry to sys.path, which allows the Python interpreter in your virtual environment to also access the system site-packages directory. Make sure your virtual environment is active, then start the Python interpreter to check the path variables:\n(env) $ python\n&gt;&gt;&gt; import sys\n&gt;&gt;&gt; from pprint import pp\n&gt;&gt;&gt; pp(sys.path)\n['',\n '/usr/local/lib/python311.zip',\n  'etc.'\n]\nUsing packages that require root permissions\nThe venv pattern is very useful for maintaining packages that do not require root permissions. This is a feature, not a bug – that way, you can have many developers independently install packages on one machine without needing to give them root permissions.\nSometimes (and particularly, in this couse) the packages we install require root permissions to work. Consider the packages that edit LED /sys/ files, like seeed-python-reterminal we install in Lab 2. We will run into an issue if we try to use these packages as normal users:\n(env) user@hostname:~/lab2/python $ python ./leds.py\n# ... output redacted\n&lt;Permissions error&gt;\nIt is unfortunately not fixable by simply using sudo:\n(env) user@hostname:~/lab2/python $ sudo python ./leds.py\n# ... output redacted\n&lt;Module seeed-python-terminal not included/available&gt;\nWhy isn’t the package available? Well, sudo runs python as the root user. The root user does not have your venv of python in its path. Try the commands below on your system to see if you understand what I mean.\n\nnormal usersudo user\n\n\n(env)jyourusername@yourhostname:~ $ which python\n# &lt;double check that the python executable comes from your venv&gt;\n\n\n(env)jyourusername@yourhostname:~ $ sudo su\n(env)root@yourhostname:~ # which python\n# &lt;you should see that the python executable is in a different place!, even though we still have \"env\"&gt;\n\n\n\nHow to resolve this problem? It is similar to the sudo echo &gt; file problem we saw with Bash. We need to make sure sudo is applying to the correct python executable. There are a few ways we can do this, all of which will look something like this:\n(env)jyourusername@yourhostname:~ $ sudo /absolute/path/to/venv/python ./leds.py\n(env)jyourusername@yourhostname:~ $ sudo ./env/relative/path/to/venv/python ./leds.py\n(env)jyourusername@yourhostname:~ $ sudo $(shell command for finding where python is installed) ./leds.py # use command substitution\nTry a few of these options out (will not work if you copy paste! Make sure you understand the commands)\nUsing a separate environment for each user\nAn alternative method to creating a virtual environment for each of your Python projects is to create a single virtual environment for your user account, and then activate that environment before running any of your Python code. This approach may be preferred if you commonly install the same set of modules for each project, and don’t want to have to bother creating individual Python environments for each project, essentially just duplicating your environment.\n$ python -m venv ~/.env\n$ source ~/.env/bin/activate\n(.env) $\nYou can check again that you’re in a separate environment by using pip list:\n(.env) $ pip list\nPackage    Version\n---------- -------\npip        23.0.1\nsetuptools 66.1.1\n…​and leave it using deactivate.\n(.env) $ deactivate\n$\nCheck library location\nCheck the location of where the module was installed with pip show &lt;module-name&gt;:\n(env) pi@raspberrypi:~ $ pip show seeed-python-reterminal\n\nName: seeed-python-reterminal\nVersion: 0.2\nSummary: seeed-python-reterminal\nHome-page: https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Seeed_Python_ReTerminal\nAuthor: Takashi Matsuoka (matsujirushi)\nAuthor-email: matsujirushi@live.jp\nLicense: MIT License\nLocation: /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages      # Library location\nRequires: evdev\nRequired-by: \nThe library is installed at: Location: /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages"

    "text": "Installing python packages using Pip\nThe goal of operating systems like Debian is to be stable, that is, unlikely to crash due to a poorly tested/implemented program. That does come at a cost of not always offering the latest versions of packages, nor having a complelely comprehensive set of the bleeding edge packages that are available.\nMany developer depend on packages that are under active development. And, there are many packages that there are no Debian maintainers for. For cases like these (and many other cases, as we’ll see) it is useful for programming languages like Python to have an independent packaging manager.\nFor python, the most commonly used package manager is pip.\n\nPip installs packages from the Python Package Index repository (pypi.org) rather than the Debian or any other package repositories.\n\nEven though Raspberry Pi OS comes with pip installed, we can’t just use it right away, as we we’ll see in the next section.\n\nAbout Python virtual environments\nIn previous versions of the operating system, it was possible to install libraries directly, system-wide, using the package installer for Python, pip. You’ll find the following sort of command in many tutorials online – including in our Labs.\n$ pip install buildhat\nIn newer versions of Raspberry Pi OS, and most other operating systems, this is disallowed. If you try and install a Python package system-wide you’ll receive an error similar to this:\n$ pip install buildhat\nerror: externally-managed-environment\n\n× This environment is externally managed\n╰─&gt; To install Python packages system-wide, try apt install\n  python3-xyz, where xyz is the package you are trying to\n  install.\n\n  If you wish to install a non-Debian-packaged Python package,\n  create a virtual environment using python3 -m venv path/to/venv.\n  Then use path/to/venv/bin/python and path/to/venv/bin/pip. Make\n  sure you have python3-full installed.\n\n  For more information visit http://rptl.io/venv\n\nnote: If you believe this is a mistake, please contact your Python installation or OS distribution provider. You can override this, at the risk of breaking your Python installation or OS, by passing --break-system-packages.\nhint: See PEP 668 for the detailed specification.\nThis error is generated because you’re trying to install a third-party package into the system Python. A long-standing practical problem for Python users has been conflicts between OS package managers like apt and Python-specific package management tools like pip. These conflicts include both Python-level API incompatibilities and conflicts over file ownership.\nTherefore from Debian Bookworm onwards, packages installed via pip must be installed into a Python virtual environment using venv. A virtual environment is a container where you can safely install third-party modules so they won’t interfere with, or break, your system Python.\n\n\nUsing pip with virtual environments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny packages that cannot be installed using apt should instead installed onto a Python Virtual Environment using venv and pip.\n\n\n\nTo use a virtual environment you will need to create a container to store the environment. There are several ways you can do this depending on how you want to work with Python.\n\n\nUsing a separate environment for each project\nOne way you can proceed is to create a new virtual environment for each Python project you make. Here, you’ll create a directory to hold your own code along with a virtual environment directory:\n$ mkdir my_project\n$ cd my_project\n$ python -m venv env\nIf you now look inside the my_project directory you’ll see a directory called env.\n$ ls -la\ntotal 12\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 pi pi 4096 Oct  3 14:34 .\ndrwx------ 20 pi pi 4096 Oct  3 14:34 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x  5 pi pi 4096 Oct  3 14:34 env\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nVery important for Lab2:\nIf you want to inherit the currently installed packages from the system Python, you should create your virtual environment using python -m venv --system-site-packages env.\nThis will include the important Raspberry PI python modules that come with RaspberryPi OS in your venv.\n\n\nInside this directory is a full Python distribution. How do we use it?\nA nice feature of venvs is that they must be activated to be used. This allows you to maintained several different venvs all over your machines to maintain many different projects with different versions of python.\nTo activate your virtual environment and make that version of Python the one you’re currently using, you should type:\n$ source env/bin/activate\n(env) $\nYou’ll see that your prompt is now prepended with (env) to indicate that you’re no longer using the system Python. Instead, you’re using the version of Python contained inside your virtual environment. Any changes you make here won’t cause problems for your system Python; nor will any new modules you install into your environment.\n(env) $ which python\n/home/username/my_project/env/bin/python\nIf you install a third-party package, it’ll install into the Python distribution in your virtual environment:\n(env) $ pip install buildhat\nLooking in indexes: https://pypi.org/simple, https://www.piwheels.org/simple\nCollecting buildhat\n  Downloading https://www.piwheels.org/simple/buildhat/buildhat-0.5.12-py3-none-any.whl (57 kB)\n     ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 57.8/57.8 kB 2.8 MB/s eta 0:00:00\nCollecting gpiozero\n  Downloading https://www.piwheels.org/simple/gpiozero/gpiozero-2.0-py3-none-any.whl (150 kB)\n     ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 150.5/150.5 kB 6.9 MB/s eta 0:00:00\nCollecting pyserial\n  Downloading https://www.piwheels.org/simple/pyserial/pyserial-3.5-py2.py3-none-any.whl (90 kB)\n     ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 90.6/90.6 kB 7.5 MB/s eta 0:00:00\nCollecting colorzero\n  Downloading https://www.piwheels.org/simple/colorzero/colorzero-2.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl (26 kB)\nRequirement already satisfied: setuptools in ./env/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from colorzero-&gt;gpiozero-&gt;buildhat) (66.1.1)\nInstalling collected packages: pyserial, colorzero, gpiozero, buildhat\nSuccessfully installed buildhat-0.5.12 colorzero-2.0 gpiozero-2.0 pyserial-3.5\n(env) $\nNow, if you pip list, you’ll see that your current version of Python includes your new modules.\n(env) $ pip list\nPackage    Version\n---------- -------\nbuildhat   0.5.12\ncolorzero  2.0\ngpiozero   2.0\npip        23.0.1\npyserial   3.5\nsetuptools 66.1.1\nAfter writing your code, you can run it from the command line inside the virtual environment as you’d expect, by invoking Python as usual.\n(env) $ ls -la\ntotal 12\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 pi pi 4096 Oct  3 14:34 .\ndrwx------ 20 pi pi 4096 Oct  3 14:34 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x  5 pi pi 4096 Oct  3 14:34 env\n-rw-r--r--  1 pi pi    0 Oct  3 14:45 my_code.py\n(env) $ python my_code.py\nHello World!\n(env) $\nYou can leave your virtual environment and return to using the system Python by typing:\n(env) $ deactivate\n$\n…​and demonstrate to yourself you’ve done so by checking the installed packages using pip list.\n\n\nIncluding system packages in your venv\nThis section has been adapted directly from realPython.com: Virtual Environments: Include the System Site-Packages. The whole article is worth skimming for reference.\nIn this class, we will often use the RaspberryPi python packages that we install system-wide (gpio, RPi, etc), and we may want to access them in the same environment where we create local virtual environments.\nThat is, while you still want to keep your projects in separate environments, you can save the effort of re-installing gpio or RPi into each of these projects.\nYou can access all modules you’ve installed to your base Python’s site-packages directory by adding the --system-site-packages flag when creating your virtual environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: If you install any additional external packages, then Python will put them into the site-packages directory of your virtual environment. You only get read access to the system site-packages directory.\n\n\n\nCreate a new virtual environment while passing this argument. You’ll see that in addition to your local site-packages directory, the path to your base Python’s site-packages directory will stick around in sys.path.\nTo test this, you can create and activate a new virtual environment using the --system-site-packages argument:\n$ python3 -m venv env --system-site-packages\n$ source venv/bin/activate\n(venv) $\nOnce again, you’ve created a new virtual environment named venv, but this time you passed the --system-site-packages argument. Adding this optional argument resulted in a different setting in your venv/pyvenv.cfg file:\n$ cat env/pyvenv.cfg\nhome = /usr/bin\ninclude-system-site-packages = true\nversion = 3.11\nBy default, the include-system-site-packages is set to false.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is common to forget to include the --system-site-packages flag when creating a venv. If you create a virtual environment and forget to include system site packages, you can include them again by changing include-system-site-packages in your environment env/pyvenv.cfg to true in your venv.\n\n\n\nThis change means that you’ll see an additional entry to sys.path, which allows the Python interpreter in your virtual environment to also access the system site-packages directory. Make sure your virtual environment is active, then start the Python interpreter to check the path variables:\n(env) $ python\n&gt;&gt;&gt; import sys\n&gt;&gt;&gt; from pprint import pp\n&gt;&gt;&gt; pp(sys.path)\n['',\n '/usr/local/lib/python311.zip',\n  'etc.'\n]\n\n\nUsing packages that require root permissions\nThe venv pattern is very useful for maintaining packages that do not require root permissions. This is a feature, not a bug – that way, you can have many developers independently install packages on one machine without needing to give them root permissions.\nSometimes (and particularly, in this couse) the packages we install require root permissions to work. Consider the packages that edit LED /sys/ files, like seeed-python-reterminal we install in Lab 2. We will run into an issue if we try to use these packages as normal users:\n(env) user@hostname:~/lab2/python $ python ./leds.py\n# ... output redacted\n&lt;Permissions error&gt;\nIt is unfortunately not fixable by simply using sudo:\n(env) user@hostname:~/lab2/python $ sudo python ./leds.py\n# ... output redacted\n&lt;Module seeed-python-terminal not included/available&gt;\nWhy isn’t the package available? Well, sudo runs python as the root user. The root user does not have your venv of python in its path. Try the commands below on your system to see if you understand what I mean.\n\nnormal usersudo user\n\n\n(env)jyourusername@yourhostname:~ $ which python\n# &lt;double check that the python executable comes from your venv&gt;\n\n\n(env)jyourusername@yourhostname:~ $ sudo su\n(env)root@yourhostname:~ # which python\n# &lt;you should see that the python executable is in a different place!, even though we still have \"env\"&gt;\n\n\n\nHow to resolve this problem? It is similar to the sudo echo &gt; file problem we saw with Bash. We need to make sure sudo is applying to the correct python executable. There are a few ways we can do this, all of which will look something like this:\n(env)jyourusername@yourhostname:~ $ sudo /absolute/path/to/venv/python ./leds.py\n(env)jyourusername@yourhostname:~ $ sudo ./env/relative/path/to/venv/python ./leds.py\n(env)jyourusername@yourhostname:~ $ sudo $(shell command for finding where python is installed) ./leds.py # use command substitution\nTry a few of these options out (will not work if you copy paste! Make sure you understand the commands)\n\n\nUsing a separate environment for each user\nAn alternative method to creating a virtual environment for each of your Python projects is to create a single virtual environment for your user account, and then activate that environment before running any of your Python code. This approach may be preferred if you commonly install the same set of modules for each project, and don’t want to have to bother creating individual Python environments for each project, essentially just duplicating your environment.\n$ python -m venv ~/.env\n$ source ~/.env/bin/activate\n(.env) $\nYou can check again that you’re in a separate environment by using pip list:\n(.env) $ pip list\nPackage    Version\n---------- -------\npip        23.0.1\nsetuptools 66.1.1\n…​and leave it using deactivate.\n(.env) $ deactivate\n$\n\n\nCheck library location\nCheck the location of where the module was installed with pip show &lt;module-name&gt;:\n(env) pi@raspberrypi:~ $ pip show seeed-python-reterminal\n\nName: seeed-python-reterminal\nVersion: 0.2\nSummary: seeed-python-reterminal\nHome-page: https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Seeed_Python_ReTerminal\nAuthor: Takashi Matsuoka (matsujirushi)\nAuthor-email: matsujirushi@live.jp\nLicense: MIT License\nLocation: /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages      # Library location\nRequires: evdev\nRequired-by: \nThe library is installed at: Location: /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages",

    "text": "Troubleshooting\n\nCheck python’s library paths\nSimilarly to Linux, there are environmental variables that determine where python will look for installed modules/libraries.\nSee the paths where python is looking for libraries with sys.path. They should look something like:\n\nsystemvenv\n\n\npi@raspberrypi:~ $ python\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; import sys      # Exposes configuration used by the python interpreter.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; sys.path        # Lists all paths where interpreter looks for modules.\n['', '/usr/lib/python311.zip', '/usr/lib/python3.11', '/usr/lib/python3.11/lib-dynload', '/usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages', '/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages', '/usr/lib/python3.11/dist-packages']\n\n\n(env) pi@raspberrypi:~ $ python\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; import sys      # Exposes configuration used by the python interpreter.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; sys.path        # Lists all paths where interpreter looks for modules.\n['', '/usr/lib/python311.zip', '/usr/lib/python3.11', '/usr/lib/python3.11/lib-dynload', '/home/pi/lab2/python/env/lib/python3.11/site-packages', '/usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages', '/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages', '/usr/lib/python3.11/dist-packages']\n\n\n\nIf the output of pip show seeed-python-reterminal is not in this list, python will not find it when you import it.\n\nNote: the python shell above was started as the user pi.

While this software is patched to fix security issues, the software is frequently not the latest version. It takes some experience to know how the repos may be changed without risk of breaking your system. Users of all levels are advised to change repos cautiously."

Note: documentation will often leave out sudo since the need to run sudo depends on the machine and the user.\n\nIn general, commands that read data (apt list, apt search, etc.) will generally not require sudo, since most folderst that apt will touch are universally readable.\napt commands that write data (apt install, etc.) to a folder not owned by the current user – which is most folders outside of /home/username, but particularly common package install locations like /usr, /bin, etc. – these commands will require sudo to gain the required write permission\n\n\n\nApt source repositories explained\nThis section has been adapted directly from the Debian documentation: see SourcesList\nApt downloads packages from one or more software repositories (sources) and installs them onto your computer.\nA repository is generally a network server, such as the official DebianStable repository. Local directories or CD/DVD are also accepted.\nThe specific repositories (package sources) configured on your machine affect: - What software packages are available for download - What versions of packages are available - Who packages the software\n\nCommonly used package sources\n\nDebianStable: official Debian repository for the current release\nStableProposedUpdates: official Debian repository for upcoming point releases (security and important bug fixes every ~2 months)\nStableUpdates: official Debian repository for changes that cannot wait for the next point release, packages are also added to StableProposedUpdates for inclusion in the next point release\nDebianSecurity: official Debian repository for frequent security updates\nDebianBackports: more recent versions of some packages, compatible with DebianStable.\nDebianUnstable: rolling development version containing the latest packages\nDebianExperimental: development version containing the experimental/alpha/beta/untested packages\n\n\n\nEditing Software Sources\nBeing able to change the repositories used by your package management system is a powerful feature but this power comes with some responsibility.\nUsers are cautioned that it is possible to break your system (in a way that could be difficult or impossible to cleanly fix) by adding third-party repositories, or repositories for a Debian version that does not match your current version - these repository create a risk of conflicting package versions, creating what’s sometimes called a “Franken-Debian” system.\nThe whole concept behind a Debian stable release is that the Debian developers have picked a set of software and their versions that function nicely together. While this software is patched to fix security issues, the software is frequently not the latest version. It takes some experience to know how the repos may be changed without risk of breaking your system. Users of all levels are advised to change repos cautiously.",
