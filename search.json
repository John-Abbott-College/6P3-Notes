Something easy to type, e.g. your first name\nEnter new UNIX username:\n# Recommended: Don't overthink this, you can always change this later\nNew password:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you forget the password for your WSL container, you can easily reset it.\nSee the Microsoft article Set up your linux username and password.\n\nAfter this, your installation is complete.\nSee the following links for more details if needed:\n\nInstall Debian on WSL\nChoosing Debian as the Linux distribution\nTroubleshooting WSL installation\n\n\n\n2.3 Configure terminal to use WSL\nFollow the steps in Set up Windows Terminal, particularly:\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’re going to spend a lot of time in terminal environments – you might as well enjoy using it. I find it motivating to use terminals that look and feel good to use. Image source\n\n\n\nEnsure your Debian WSL instance is the default profile\n\nThen, pin Windows Terminal to your taskbar, ideally as the first app\nUse Win+1 to open Windows Terminal automatically.\n\nChoose a theme\nChoose a color scheme\n\nCustomizing a color scheme\n\nPractise searching through terminal output using Ctrl+Shift+F\nMake sure you know how to copy/paste text in Windows Terminal\n\nYou can also use Ctrl+Shift+c and Ctrl+Shift+v to copy/paste in terminals\nYou can also use Ctrl+Insert and Shift+Insert to copy paste in terminals\n\nUse Ctrl+Shift+P to open the command palette to do almost any terminal config command (very similar to VSCode).\n\nThis is very useful for learning hotkeys for the following things:\n\nmaking terminal panes\nchanging focus\n\n\n\nSee Troubleshooting Windows Terminal for more details.\n\n\n2.4 Install dependencies\n\n2.4.1 Perform system update\n\n\nbash\n\n# Update system:\nsudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y\n\n\n\n2.4.2 Install python\n\n\nbash\n\n# Verify python version is &gt;= 3.9:\npython3 --version\n# Ensure pip is installed:\nsudo apt install python3-pip\npip3 --version\n\n\n\n2.4.3 Set up git\nYou’ll need to do the following to set up git on both your WSL:\n\n\nbash\n\nsudo apt install git\ngit config --global user.name \"Your Name\"\ngit config --global user.email \"youremail@domain.com\"\n\nSee Installing Git for more detail if needed.\n\n\n2.4.4 Install other needed tools\nWe’re going to need the following packages:\n\n\nbash\n\nsudo apt install man ssh wget ca-certificates rsync pass pass-extension-otp zbar-tools vim\n\nLast update to this command: February 23, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf, when running sudo apt install, you have an error like this:\n\n\nbash\n\nE: Failed to fetch &lt;url&gt; 404 Not Found [IP: &lt;ip&gt;]\nE: Unable to fetch some archives, maybe run apt get update or try with --fix-missing?\n\nMake sure you update the system:\n\n\nbash\n\n# you can also run sudo apt upgrade -y, but it's not necessary all the time.\nsudo apt update\n\nThen, try the installation command again.\n\n\nI’ll keep this command updated throughout the semester as we encounter more packages we need.\n\n\n\n2.5 Backup container to OneDrive\nOnce the initial setup is complete, backups of the WSL container are easy to make.\nOnce a backup is made, it’s easy to:\n\nrecreate the exact same image on a new machine\nrestore your image in case the disk is wiped (this seems to be happening to our lab computers…)\n\n\n2.5.1 Backup command\nFirst, let’s ensure you have a folder to keep your backups.\nRecommendation: store WSL images on your college OneDrive account. That way, you can easily share your image with your personal computer, and restore your image automatically using any college computer.\n\n\nPowershell\n\nPS &gt; md -Force \"C:\\Users\\&lt;your-username&gt;\\OneDrive\\420-6P3-W25\"\n\nThen, we’ll use wsl --export to make a backup copy of your WSL container:\n\n\nPowershell\n\n# This can take around 5 minutes to finish.\nPS &gt; wsl --export Debian \"C:\\Users\\&lt;your-username\\OneDrive\\420-6P3-W25\\debian.tar\n\n\n\n2.5.2 Restore command\nOn a new machine (or on a machine with a freshly wiped hard drive…) you can --import the backup image you created:\n\n\nPowershell\n\n# This can take around 5 minutes to finish.\nPS &gt; wsl --import Debian .\\Debian \"C:\\Users\\&lt;your-username&gt;\\OneDrive\\debian.tar\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAfter restoring WSL, you will find that you are automatically logged in as root instead of your username.\nThe way to set a default user in a WSL container instance is to create a [user] entry in the container’s /etc/wsl.conf file:\nOpen your wsl instance and add the following entry to /etc/wsl.conf:\n\n\n/etc/wsl.conf\n\n[user]\ndefault=username\n\nExit your distro/instance, then run a wsl --terminate &lt;distroname&gt; from PowerShell.\nWhen you restart, the default user should be set to username.\nFor more detail: https://superuser.com/a/1627461"

    "section": "1 Bash theory",
    "text": "1 Bash theory\nBash (and other shell languages) isn’t really a programming language – it is a command interpreter that’s best used for organizing the inputs and outputs of programs written in other languages. Historically this would be the C programming language. In our class, we will be writing “real” programs in Python.\nBut I digress. Despite the fact that Bash isn’t a programming language like C or Python, you can still program in it. What do you need to know to write Bash programs?\nThese notes will cover the basic programming concepts you need to know to get the most out of writing scripts in Bash.\n\n1.1 Variables\nThis section was adapted from (“Variable Substitution” n.d.)\nIn Bash, there is no concept of “types” – this is not a compiled language where different amounts of memory need to be reserved for different types of data.\nRather, all variables in Bash are simply value-placeholders. That is:\n\nThe name of a variable is a placeholder for its value, which is the data that it holds.\nReferencing/retrieving the value of a variable is called variable substitution.\n\nFor example, if variable1 is the name of a variable, then $variable1 is a reference to its value, the data it contains.\nAn equivalent syntax for variable substitution that is generally more robust is to add curly braces, as in: ${variable1}\nRunning a command such as echo $variable1 or echo ${variable1} will cause the value referenced by variable1 to be substituted and passed to the echo command.\nHere’s an example of variable assignment and substitution:\n\n\nbash\n\n# Create a variable with the name \"a\" and the value \"375\"\n$ a=375\n\n# Create a variable with the name \"hello\" and the value of the variable \"a\" (375)\n$ hello=$a\n\n# Not a variable reference, just the string \"hello\" ...\n$ echo hello\nhello\n\n# This *is* a variable substitution\n$ echo $hello\n375\n\n# This is another way to do a variable substitution\necho ${hello}\n375\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNo spaces are permitted on either side of = sign when initializing variables.\n\n\n1.1.1 Variable names\nWhat can you name variables? Here are the rules:\n\nVariable names must start with a letter (not a number or any other character)\nVariable names cannot contain whitespace or punctuation\n\n\n\n1.1.2 Command substitution\nWe can also assign the results of a command to a variable:\n\n\nbash\n\n# The \"%x %r %Z\" string is an example of a date format string.\n# See `man date` for examples of other date format strings\nright_now=\"$(date +\"%x %r %Z\")\"\n\nThe characters $( ) tell the shell: “substitute the results of the enclosed command”. This technique is known as command substitution.\nIn the above example script, the variable right_now gets assigned the result of calling the date command with with the argument \"%x %r %Z\" which outputs the current date and time.\nLike variable substitutions, it is a good idea to wrap command substitutions in double quotes to prevent unwanted word splitting in case the result of the expansion contains whitespace characters – see the (#Quoting) section below.\n\n\n1.1.3 Environment variables\nThis section was adapted from (“Writing Shell Scripts - Lesson 4: Variables” n.d.) and (“Export Man Page - Linux - SS64.com” n.d.)\nAny time a shell session is initialized, some variables are already set by startup files.\nTo see all the variables that are in the environment, use the printenv command:\n\n\nbash\n\n$ printenv\nSHELL=/bin/bash\n...\n\nYou can also view environment variables in a bash session using echo:\n\n\nbash\n\n$ echo $SHELL\n/bin/bash\n\nYou can create your own environment variables using the export command.\n\n\nbash\n\n$ MYDEPT=Sales\n$ echo $MYDEPT\nSales\n$ export MYDEPT\n\n# In one line:\nexport SOMEOTHERVAR=Value\n\n\n\n\n1.2 Quoting\nThis section was adapted from (“Quoting” n.d.)\nQuoting means just that, bracketing a string in quotes. This has the effect of protecting special characters in the string from reinterpretation or expansion by the shell or shell script.\n\nA character is special if it has an interpretation other than its literal meaning. For example, the asterisk * represents a wild card character in globbing and Regular Expressions.\n\n\n\nbash\n\n$ ls -l [Vv]*\n-rw-rw-r--    1 bozo  bozo       324 Apr  2 15:05 VIEWDATA.BAT\n-rw-rw-r--    1 bozo  bozo       507 May  4 14:25 vartrace.sh\n-rw-rw-r--    1 bozo  bozo       539 Apr 14 17:11 viewdata.sh\n\n$ ls -l '[Vv]*'\nls: [Vv]*: No such file or directory\n\n$ ls -l '[vv]*'\nls: [vv]*: no such file or directory\n\n\n1.2.1 Quoting variables\nWhen referencing a variable, it is generally advisable to enclose its name in double quotes, like so:\n\n\nbash\n\n$ local var=\"string-with-special-characters#*;&gt;,\"\n$ echo \"$var\"\nstring-with-special-characters#*;&gt;,\n\nThis prevents reinterpretation of all special characters within the quoted string, with the following exceptions:\n\n$ (used for variable dereferencing)\n\\ (escape character)\n\nKeeping $ as a special character within double quotes permits referencing a quoted variable ($variable), that is, replacing the variable with its value in the resulting string.\nUsing double quotes also prevents word splitting. An argument enclosed in double quotes presents itself as a single word, even if it contains whitespace separators.\n\n\nbash\n\nList=\"one two three\"\n\nfor a in $List     # Splits the variable in parts at whitespace.\ndo\n  echo \"$a\"\ndone\n# one\n# two\n# three\n\necho \"---\"\n\nfor a in \"$List\"   # Preserves whitespace in a single variable.\ndo #     ^     ^\n  echo \"$a\"\ndone\n# one two three\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Escaping\nEscaping is a method of quoting single characters. The escape \\ preceding a character tells the shell to interpret that character literally.\n\n\nbash\n\n$ echo \"Hello world\"\nHello world\n\n$ echo \"Hello \\\"world\\\"\"\nHello \"world\"\n\nYou can see more examples and information on escaping here.\n\n\n1.2.3 Single quotes\nSingle quotes ' operate similarly to double quotes, but do not permit referencing variables, since the special meaning of $ is turned off.\nWithin single quotes, every special character except ' gets interpreted literally. Consider single quotes (‘full quoting’) to be a stricter method of quoting than double quotes (“partial quoting”).\nSince even the escape character \\ gets a literal interpretation within single quotes, trying to enclose a single quote within single quotes will not yield the expected result.\n\n\n\n1.3 Functions\nThis section was adapted from (“Writing Shell Scripts - Lesson 6: Shell Functions” n.d.)\nAs programs get longer and more complex, they become more difficult to design, code, and maintain. As with any large endeavor, it is often useful to break a single, large task into a series of smaller tasks. We can do this with functions.\nA couple of important points about functions in bash:\n\nThey must be defined before they can be used.\nSecond, the function body (the portions of the function between the { and } characters) must contain at least one valid command.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n\nbash\n\n# The function definition must come before any function calls\nsystem_info()\n{\n  # At least one valid command is required in a function body\n  echo \"function system_info\"\n}\n\n# No brackets are included in the function call\nsystem_info\n\nRunning the above lines will define the system_info() function, then call it, simply result in the echo command running.\n\n1.3.1 Positional parameters\nFunctions in bash support positional parameters by default. This allows us to do things like specify the name of the output file on the command line, as well as set a default output file name if no name is specified.\nPositional parameters are a series of special variables ($0 through $9) that contain the contents of the command line.\nFor example, let’s change the earlier function definition above slightly:\n\n\nbash\n\nsystem_info()\n{\n  echo \"$1\"\n  echo \"$2\"\n  echo \"$3\"\n}\n\nThen, let’s see what happens if we were to use this function:\n\n\nbash\n\n$ system_info Hello world !\nHello\nworld\n!\n\n$ system_info \"Hello world!\" \"How are you?\" \"I'm good, thanks!\"\nHello world!\nHow are you?\nI'm good, thanks!\n\n\n\n1.3.2 Detecting positional parameters\nOften, we will want to check to see if we have command line arguments on which to act. There are a couple of ways to do this. First, we could simply check to see if $1 contains anything like so:\n\n\nbash\n\nif [ \"$1\" != \"\" ]; then\n    echo \"Positional parameter 1 contains something\"\nelse\n    echo \"Positional parameter 1 is empty\"\nfi\n\nSecond, the shell maintains a variable called $# that contains the number of items on the command line in addition to the name of the command ($0).\n\n\nbash\n\n# -gt means \"greater than\" in Bash, and -lt is \"less than\".\nif [ $# -gt 0 ]; then\n    echo \"Your command line contains $# arguments\"\nelse\n    echo \"Your command line contains no arguments\"\nfi\n\n\n\n\n1.4 Conditionals\nThis section was adapted from (“Writing Shell Scripts - Lesson 8: Flow Control - Part 1” n.d.)\nMost programs need to make decisions and perform different actions depending on various conditions. In bash, there are two main things to know for achieving conditional logic:\n\nHow the shell evaluates the success or failure of a command (Exit status)\nHow the shell can control the flow of execution in our program.\n\nThese two things are elaborated in the following sections.\n\n1.4.1 Exit status\nCommands (including the scripts and shell functions we write) issue a value to the system when they terminate, called an exit status. This value, which is an integer in the range of 0 to 2551, indicates the success or failure of the command’s execution. By convention, a value of zero indicates success and any other value indicates failure.\n1 Most of these numbers aren’t used – 0 (success) and 1 (failure) are most common. You can see a useful discussion of where to find more information about exit codes on stackoverflow.The shell provides a parameter $? that we can use to examine the exit status of the previously run command. Here we see it in action:\n\n\nbash\n\n$ ls -d /usr/bin\n/usr/bin\n\n# The last command terminated sucessfully, so we have a zero exit code when calling $?\n$ echo $?\n0\n\n$ ls -d /bin/usr\nls: cannot access /bin/usr: No such file or directory\n\n# The last command did not terminate successfully, so we have a non-zero exit code when calling $?\n$ echo $?\n2\n\nSome commands use different exit status values to provide diagnostics for errors, while many commands simply exit with a value of one when they fail. man pages often include a section entitled “Exit Status,” describing what codes are used. However, a zero always indicates success.\nThe shell provides two extremely simple builtin commands that do nothing except terminate with either a zero or one exit status. The true command always executes successfully and the false command always executes unsuccessfully:\n\n\nbash\n\n$ true\n$ echo $?\n0\n$ false\n$ echo $?\n1\n\nWe can use these commands to see how the if statement works. What the if statement really does is evaluate the success or failure of commands:\n\n\nbash\n\n$ if true; then echo \"It's true.\"; fi\nIt's true.\n\n$ if false; then echo \"It's true.\"; fi\n$\n\nThe command echo “It’s true.” is executed when the command following if executes successfully, and is not executed when the command following if does not execute successfully.\n\n\n1.4.2 exit\nWe can (and should!) set the exit status of our own scripts when they finish. To do this, use the exit command. The exit command causes the script to terminate immediately and set the exit status to whatever value is given as an argument.\nFor example: exit 0 exits our script and sets the exit status to 0 (success), whereas exit 1 exits your script and sets the exit status to 1 (failure).\n\n\n1.4.3 if\nThe if command is fairly simple on the surface; it makes a decision based on the exit status of a command. The if command’s syntax looks like this:\n\n\nbash\n\nif commands; then\n    commands\n[elif commands; then\n    commands...]\n[else\n    commands]\nfi\n\nTypically, you will see the if command combined with the test command, seen below.\n\n\n1.4.4 test\nThe test command is used most often with the if command to perform true/false decisions.\nThe command is unusual in that it has two different syntactic forms:\n\n\nbash\n\n# First form\ntest expression\n\n# Second form, which is far more common\n# Note: the word \"test\" does not appear, but this is in fact a \"test\" command!\n[ expression ]\n\n\n\nNotice the spaces between the [ ] braces and the expression – the whitespace is required.\nThe test command works simply. If the given expression is true, test exits with a status of zero; otherwise it exits with a status of 1.\nThe neat feature of test is the variety of expressions we can create. Here is an example:\n\n\nbash\n\nif [ -f .bash_profile ]; then\n    echo \"You have a .bash_profile. Things are fine.\"\nelse\n    echo \"Yikes! You have no .bash_profile!\"\nfi\n\nIn this example, we use the expression -f .bash_profile. This expression asks, “Is .bash_profile a file?” If the expression is true, then test exits with a zero (indicating true) and the if command executes the command(s) following the word then. If the expression is false, then test exits with a status of one and the if command executes the command(s) following the word else.\nHere is a partial list of the conditions that test can evaluate. Since test is a shell builtin, use help test to see a complete list:\n\n\n\nExpression\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n-d file\nTrue if file is a directory.\n\n\n-e file\nTrue if file exists.\n\n\n-f file\nTrue if file exists and is a regular file.\n\n\n-L file\nTrue if file is a symbolic link.\n\n\n-r file\nTrue if file is a file readable by you.\n\n\n-w file\nTrue if file is a file writable by you.\n\n\n-x file\nTrue if file is a file executable by you.\n\n\nfile1 -nt file2\nTrue if file1 is newer than file2.\n\n\nfile1 -ot file2\nTrue if file1 is older than file2.\n\n\n-z string\nTrue if string is empty.\n\n\n-n string\nTrue if string is not empty.\n\n\nstring1 = string2\nTrue if string1 equals string2.\n\n\nstring1 != string2\nTrue if string1 does not equal string2.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.5 A quick note on syntax\nNote that the above example can be written in a few ways:\n\n\nbash\n\n# Preferred form\nif [ -f .bash_profile ]; then\n    echo \"You have a .bash_profile. Things are fine.\"\nelse\n    echo \"Yikes! You have no .bash_profile!\"\nfi\n\n# Alternate form\nif [ -f .bash_profile ]\nthen echo \"You have a .bash_profile. Things are fine.\"\nelse echo \"Yikes! You have no .bash_profile!\"\nfi\n\nThe semicolon ; is a command separator. Using it allows us to put more than one command on a line.\nFor example: $ clear; ls will clear the screen, then execute the ls command.\nWe use the semicolon as we did to allow us to put the word then on the same line as the if command, because it’s easier to read that way."

    "section": "2 Code reuse",
    "text": "2 Code reuse\nThe primary goal of writing a program in any language is to cryztalize useful logic in a reusable form – that is, to write a program. The outcome is that you don’t need to repeat yourself once you’ve solved a problem once.\nIn bash there are two main avenues we will take to achieve this goal:\n\ncreate function libraries\ncreate executable scripts\n\nThe following sections elaborate each technique.\n\n2.1 Function library with source\nThis section was adapted from (“Linux Command Line Adventure: Source” n.d.)\nMost programming languages permit programmers to specify external files to be included within their programs. This is often used to add “boilerplate” code to programs for such things as defining standard constants and referencing external library function definitions.\nBash has a builtin command, source, that implements this feature. This section will cover the ways it can make our scripts more powerful and easier to maintain.\nsource reads a specified file and executes the commands within it using the current shell. It works both with the interactive command line and within a script. Using the command line for example, we can reload the .bashrc file by executing the following command:\n$ source ~/.bashrc\nNote that the source command can be abbreviated by a single dot character like so:\n$ . ~/.bashrc\nWhen source is used on the command line, the commands in the file are treated as if they are being typed directly at the keyboard. In a shell script, the commands are treated as though they are part of the script.\nsource is a natural way to share functions and variables across many bash programs. For example, it makes sense to have a shared function to display error messages:\n\n\nbash\n\nerror_msg() {\n  printf \"%s\\n\" \"$1\" &gt;&2\n}\n\nTo share these functions across other scripts, we could build a library of functions and source that library. As an example, we could put all the common code in a file called ~/bash-scripts.sh and add the following code to both scripts to source that file:\n\n\nbash\n\nFUNCLIB=~/bash-scripts.sh\n\nif [[ -r \"$FUNCLIB\" ]]; then\n    source \"$FUNCLIB\"\nelse\n    echo \"Cannot read function library!\" &gt;&2\n    exit 1\nfi\n\nIf you put source statements like this in your ~/.bashrc, your functions will always be available each time you open a new terminal instance.\n\n\n2.2 Scripts\n\n2.2.1 Shebangs\n\n\n2.2.2 Permissions\nThis section was adapted from (“How-To: Set Permissions in Bash - Linux - SS64.com” n.d.)\n\n2.2.2.1 View permissions with ls\nThe ouptut of ls -l will show the current permissions for files and folders:\n-rwxr--rw- 1 user user 0 Jan 19 12:59 file1.txt\nThe letters rwx stand for Read/Write/Execute permission. These rights are shown three times, first for the Owner, then the Group and lastly Others (world)\n\n\n2.2.2.2 Edit permissions with chmod\nThe command to modify permissions is chmod. There are two ways to modify permissions, with numbers or with letters.\nCheck out this this chmod documentation for a really great interactive demo.\n\n2.2.2.2.1 Numeric\n\nchmod 400 file - Read by owner\nchmod 040 file - Read by group\nchmod 004 file - Read by world\nchmod 200 file - Write by owner\nchmod 020 file - Write by group\nchmod 002 file - Write by world\nchmod 100 file - execute by owner\nchmod 010 file - execute by group\nchmod 001 file - execute by world\n\nTo combine these, just add the numbers together:\n\nchmod 444 file - Allow read permission to owner and group and world\nchmod 777 file - Allow everyone to read, write, and execute file\n\n\n\n2.2.2.2.2 Symbolic\nchmod also accepts symbolic arguments for permission changes, where:\n\nrwx: read/write/execute\nugo: user/group/world\n\nSome examples:\n\nDeny execute permission to everyone: $ chmod a-x file\nAllow read permission to everyone: $ chmod a+r file\nMake a file readable and writable by the group and others: $ chmod go+rw file\nMake a shell script executable by the user/owner: $ chmod u+x myscript.sh\nAllow everyone to read, write, and execute the file and turn on the set group-ID: $ chmod =rwx,g+s file\n\nSome files are configured to have very restrictive permissions to prevent unauthorized access. Changing these permissions can create security problems.\nTo change or edit files that are owned by root, sudo chmod must be used. Note that changing permissions incorrectly can quickly make your system unusable! Please be careful when using sudo!\n$ sudo chmod o+x /usr/local/bin/somefile\n\n\n\n2.2.2.3 Recursive Permission Changes\nchmod -R will change all the permissions of each file and folder under a specified directory at once.\nFor example, $ chmod 777 -R /path/to/Dir will grant read/write/execute permissions to all users for ALL files in /path/to/Dir.\nTo assign reasonably secure permissions to files and folders/directories, it’s common to give files a permission of 644, and directories a 755 permission, using the find command and a pipe we can target just files or just folders as in the following examples.\n$ sudo find /path/to/Dir -type f -print0 | xargs -0 sudo chmod 644`\n$ sudo find /path/to/Dir -type d -print0 | xargs -0 sudo chmod 755\nAgain if using sudo be careful, in particular watch for extra spaces in your command/path.\n\n\n2.2.2.4 Changing Ownership and Group membership\nA file’s owner can be changed using the chown command.\n$ sudo chown kate file1.txt\nA file’s group can also be changed using the chown command.\n$ sudo chown :mygroup file1.txt\nchown can also change the owner and group in a single command:\n$ sudo chown tux:mygroup file1.txt\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Style\nIn general, when I provide starter scripts for you, you should try to follow the “style” of the code. That is:\nYou can see the following resources for style guides:"

    "section": "3 Authentication",
    "text": "3 Authentication\nMany git operations require authentication to get permission. Some examples:\n\nPushing to a repository\nPulling from a private repository\nUsing GitHub CLI\n\nSince July 2021, GitHub no longer accepts account passwords to authenticate git operations. You have probably run into this error many times when trying to push changes or clone your private repositories on a new machine.\nThe only reason VSCode works out of the box is because VSCode and GitHub are integrated by default, both being owned by Microsoft.\nThe following sections gives us more flexible and useful ways to authenticate git commands with GitHub.\n\n3.1 Creating a personal access token\nRead “Managing your personal access tokens” on Github, and create a classic (not fine-grained) personal access token.\nAt the very least, select the repo scope – this will give your token the ability to authenticate using git on the CLI. You can select all other scopes as well if you like.\nOnce you’re finished, you’ll see your token is a string of the following form:\nghp_&lt;long string of letters and numbers&gt;\nKeep this window open – the string of characters will disappear as soon as you refresh the page.\nWe need to configure a secure storage location for this string. For this, we will use the tool pass.\n\n\n3.2 Using a password manager to store your token\nSecrets like personal access tokens need to be readily accessible to be useful – but they also should be secret, so that others cannot easily impersonate you using the token.\nA common method for managing secrets is to use a password manager. In our course we use pass to securely manage our personal access tokens on our developer environment.\n\n3.2.1 Install pass dependencies\nFirst, ensure pass and some useful related dependencies are installed:\n# On WSL / Linux\nsudo apt install pass pass-extension-otp zbar-tools\n\n# On macOS\nbrew install pass pass-otp zbar\n\n\n3.2.2 Set up gpg\npass works by using asymmetric key encryption to store secrets. That means: you posess the private key that can decrypt secrets, and you make the public key available which can encrypt secrets.\nThis scheme is not only useful for private communication (something similar is used by apps like Signal and Telegram), but also for storing any secrets – for us, we will store our github token as a secret.\nTo get started, you’ll need to generated a gpg key-pair in order to use pass.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe GitHub instructions mention using git bash – ignore them, you have a developer environment to use instead.\nIn general, when I link to external instructions, you will need to pay attention to what parts of them may be different in our class. This is a good skill in general for making effective use of resources posted online when learning a new skill.\n\n\nFollow the instructions below:\n\nCreate the gpg key-pair following the instructions on GitHub: Generating a new GPG key\nrun gpg --full-generate-key to get started.\nRecommended: You can accept the default key type (RSA)\nRecommended: Choose 4096 bits for the keysize.\nRecommended: You can accept the default “does not expire” option.\nEnter user ID information. This information should match what you have provided to GitHub already (username/email address)\nYou have to choose a password for GPG keys. Choose something strong that you can remember.\nAdd the public key to your GitHub account following the instructions: Adding a GPG Key to your GitHub account.\n\nThe name of the key on GitHub does not matter (Personal GPG Key is fine)\nThe command: gpg --armor --export prints your key to the console, you can copy/paste this output for GitHub\nEven better: use a pipe to clip.exe to put the key in your clipboard automatically with gpg --armor --export | clip.exe\n\non macOS: use pbcopy instead of clip.exe\non Linux: use xclip or wl-copy instead of clip.exe\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Store personal access token in pass\nOnce you’ve created the gpg key-pair, we can now set up pass:\npass init &lt;the-email-you-used-for-gpg-key&gt;\nFinally, copy the token string from GitHub to your clipboard. Then, open your developer terminal:\n$ pass insert github/token\nEnter password for github/token: # paste your token here, then press enter\nOnce you’ve done this, you should be able to access your token using pass github/token, or pass github/token | clip.exe to place it on your clipboard directly.\n\n\n\n3.3 Troubleshooting\nSome common errors that arise with using gpg:\n\n3.3.1 No secret key\nThis error looks like:\n\n\nbash\n\n$ pass github/token\ngpg: decryption failed: No secret key\n\nTry the following:\n\n3.3.1.1 Double check the password store setup\nConfirm that your password store is encrypted with the gpg key you expect:\n\n\nbash\n\n# This command prints out your gpg key information\n$ gpg -k \n\n# This command shows the gpg key used to encrypt your password-store\n$ cat ~/.password-store/.gpg-id\n\n# The id and/or email address should match for both!\n\n\n\n3.3.1.2 Restart gpg daemon\n\n\nbash\n\n$ gpgconf --kill gpg-agent\n\nIf that doesn’t work, try restarting your WSL instance. In powershell:\n\n\nPowershell\n\nPS &gt; wsl --shutdown &lt;distro-name&gt;\n\nAfter the shutdown attempt, retry using pass in the WSL again."

    "text": "1 Using CLI effectively\nFirst things first: the terminal can feel awkward to use. What can we do about this?\nEach section below is some set of tips for using the interactive bash CLI effectively.\n\n1.1 Keyboard shortcuts\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeyboard Shortcuts: details & examples\n\n\n\n\n\nThis section was adapted from (“Bash Keyboard Shortcuts - Linux - SS64.com” n.d.).\n\n1.1.1 Completions\nUse TAB completion for file/directory names. Type just enough characters to uniquely identify the item.\nFor example, to move to a directory sample1; Type cd sam. Then press TAB and ENTER.\n\n\n1.1.2 Moving the cursor\n\nCtrl+a: Go to the beginning of the line (Home).\nCtrl+e: Go to the End of the line (End).\nCtrl+p: Previous command (Up arrow).\nCtrl+n: Next command (Down arrow).\nAlt+b: Back (left) one word.\nAlt+f: Forward (right) one word.\nCtrl+f: Forward one character.\nCtrl+b: Backward one character.\n\n\n\n1.1.3 While using man or command --help | less\n\nk: Scroll up one line\nj: Scroll down one line\nCtrl+u: Page up\nCtrl+d: Page down\n/: Begin forward search\n?: Begin reverse search\nn/N: Find next/previous match\nq: close the less pager\n\n\n\n1.1.4 Editing\n\nCtrl+L: Clear the Screen, similar to the clear command.\nAlt+Del: Delete the Word before the cursor.\nAlt+d: Delete the Word after the cursor.\nCtrl+d: Delete character under the cursor.\nCtrl+h: Delete character before the cursor (Backspace).\nCtrl+w: Cut the Word before the cursor to the clipboard.\nCtrl+k: Cut the Line after the cursor to the clipboard.\nCtrl+u: Cut/delete the Line before the cursor to the clipboard.\nAlt+t: Swap current word with previous.\nCtrl+t: Swap the last two characters before the cursor (typo).\nctrl+y: Paste the last thing to be cut (yank).\nAlt+u: UPPER capitalize every character from the cursor to the end of the current word.\nAlt+l: Lower the case of every character from the cursor to the end of the current word.\nAlt+c: Capitalize the character under the cursor and move to the end of the word.\nAlt+r: Cancel the changes and put back the line as it was in the history (revert).\nctrl+_: Undo.\n\n\n\n1.1.5 Special keys\n\nCtrl+v tells the terminal to not interpret the following character\n\nso Ctrl+v TAB will display a tab character rather than attempting completion.\nsimilarly Ctrl+v ENTER will display the escape sequence for the Enter key: ^M\n\n\n\n\n1.1.6 History\n\nCtrl+r: Recall the last command including the specified character(s).\nCtrl+p: Previous command in history (walk back).\nCtrl+n: Next command in history (walk forward).\nCtrl+o: Execute the command found via Ctrl+r or Ctrl+s Ctrl+o\nCtrl+g: Escape from history searching mode.\n\n\n\n1.1.7 Process Control\n\nCtrl+c: Interrupt/Kill whatever you are running (SIGINT).\nCtrl+l: Clear the screen.\nCtrl+s: Stop output to the screen (for long running verbose commands). Then use PgUp/PgDn for navigation.\nCtrl+q: Allow output to the screen (if previously stopped using command above).\nCtrl+d: Send an EOF marker, unless disabled by an option, this will close the current shell (EXIT).\nCtrl+z: Send the signal SIGTSTP to the current task, which suspends it. To return to it later enter fg 'process name'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2 Configuration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.bashrc details & examples\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery time you open a new terminal window/tab in the bash shell, the ~/.bashrc file is read and executed.\nThe typical usecases for customising ~/.bashrc are:\n\nsetting a custom Command prompt\nsetting various useful shopts (shell options)\nsetting environment variables/aliases\nsourcing other bash files\n\nExamples of each of these are shown below.\n\n\n~/.bashrc\n\n# Set a prompt like: [username@hostname:~/CurrentWorkingDirectory]$\nexport PS1='[\\u@\\h:\\w]\\$ '\n#   Explanation:\n#   \\u: username\n#   \\h: hostname\n#   \\w: the current working directory\n#   \\$: the character $\n#   all other characters are interpreted literally\n#   See https://ss64.com/bash/syntax-prompt.html for more examples\n\n# Set useful shell options\nshopt -s autocd # auto-appends `cd` to directory, so you can cd to a path without writing `cd`\nshopt -s globstar # enables the pattern '**' for recursive file/directory wildcard matching\nshopt -s extglob # fancier pattern matching\n# See https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/The-Shopt-Builtin.html for more options\n\n# Set environment variables/aliases\nexport EDITOR=\"nvim\" # neovim\nexport EDITOR=\"code\" # vscode (overwrites previous line)\n# See https://ss64.com/bash/export.html for more information\n\nalias ll=\"ls -l\" # create new alias ll for a long list\nalias cp=\"cp -iv\" # replace default cp command with interactive/verbose cp\n# See https://ss64.com/bash/alias.html for more alias info and examples\n# Note that aliases cannot handle complex logic or accept positional parameters\n# For that, we would need functions.\n\n# Source all bash files in ~/.bashrc.d/\n# This lets you define functions in various shell files in this folder and source them at startup.\nif [ -d ~/.bashrc.d ]; then\n    for rc in ~/.bashrc.d/*; do\n        if [ -f \"$rc\" ]; then\n            source \"$rc\"\n        fi\n    done\nfi\nunset rc\n# See https://ss64.com/bash/source.html for more info on sourcing\n\n\n1.2.1 Ever Wonder Why it’s Called .bashrc?\nThere are many files that end with the mysterious suffix rc like .bashrc, .vimrc, etc. Why is that? It’s a holdover from ancient Unix. Its original meaning was “run commands,” but it later became “run-control.” A run-control file is generally some kind of script or configuration file that prepares an environment for a program to use. In the case of .bashrc for example, it’s a script that prepares a user’s bash shell environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.profile details & examples\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery time you log in to a linux user, the ~/.profile file is read and executed.\nThe typical usecases for customizing ~/.profile are:\n\nsetting environment variables INDEPENDENT of bash instances\n\ni.e., these variables will work in sh, zsh, and other shells\n\nsetting environment variables once per session\n\nparticularly useful for PATH, since setting it in ~/.bashrc will cause it to be updated more frequently than useful\n\n\nExamples of these are shown below:\n\n\n~/.profile\n\n# Add a directory to PATH, checking if that directory is not already in PATH first\nif ! [[ \"$PATH\" =~ \"$HOME/bin:\" ]]; then\n  export PATH=\"$PATH:$HOME/bin\"  # Adds ~/bin to your path\nfi\n\n# Source all profile files in ~/.profile.d/\n# This is useful for programs like npm, you can put its bashrc/path stuff in here instead.\nfor script in $HOME/.profile.d/*.sh ; do\n    if [ -r \"$script\" ] ; then\n        . \"$script\"\n    fi\ndone\nunset script\n# See https://ss64.com/bash/source.html for more info on sourcing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.inputrc details & examples\n\n\n\n\n\nThis section was adapted from (“How-To: Bash Startup Files Inputrc - Linux - SS64.com” n.d.).\nThe library that is used to implement a command line interface for bash is called the Readline library.\nWhile it comes with a set of default keybindings (see the #keyboard-shortcuts section), it is possible to modify these and other behaviors of the CLI interface by putting commands into a .inputrc file, typically in the home directory.\nThe configuration options in .inputrc are particularly useful for customising the way Tab-completion works, e.g. with the ls command.\nThe inputrc variable syntax is simple:\nset variable value\nBelow are a list of variables I find particularly useful, as well as a sample .inputrc file showing how each of these are set.\n\nbell-style\nControls what happens when Readline wants to ring the terminal bell. If set to ‘none’, Readline never rings the bell. If set to ‘visible’, Readline uses a visible bell if one is available. If set to ‘audible’ (the default), Readline attempts to ring the terminal’s bell.\ncompletion-ignore-case\nIf set to ‘on’, Readline performs filename matching and completion in a case-insensitive fashion. The default value is ‘off’.\nediting-mode\nThe editing-mode variable controls which default set of key bindings is used. By default, Readline starts up in Emacs editing mode, where the keystrokes are most similar to Emacs. This variable can be set to either ‘emacs’ or ‘vi’.\nmark-symlinked-directories\nIf set to ‘on’, completed names which are symbolic links to directories have a slash appended (subject to the value of mark-directories). The default is ‘off’.\nshow-all-if-ambiguous\nThis alters the default behavior of the completion functions. If set to ‘on’, words which have more than one possible completion cause the matches to be listed immediately instead of ringing the bell. The default value is ‘off’.\n\nA sample ~/.inputrc file with these variables in use:\n\n\n~/.inputrc\n\nset bell-style none\nset completion-ignore-case On\nset editing-mode vi\nset mark-symlinked-directories On\nset show-all-if-ambiguous On\n\nYou can find many more configuration options in (“How-To: Bash Startup Files Inputrc - Linux - SS64.com” n.d.)."

    "section": "4 Redirection and Pipes",
    "text": "4 Redirection and Pipes\nThis section was adapted from (“How-To: Redirection and Process Substitution - Linux - SS64.com” n.d.)\nWhen Bash starts, normally, 3 file descriptors are opened, 0, 1 and 2 also known as standard input (stdin), standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr).\nYou can use the &gt; operator to “redirect” the output of commands (which normally goes to stdout) to different files or other file descriptors. Some common examples are shown below:\n\ncommand  &gt;  filename     Redirect command output (stdout) into a file\ncommand  &gt;  /dev/null    Discard stdout of command\ncommand  2&gt; /dev/null    Discard stderr of command\n\ncommand  &gt;&2             Redirect command output (stdout) to stderr\n\ncommand  &gt;&gt; filename     Redirect command output and APPEND into a file\ncommand  &lt;  filename     Redirect a file into a command\n\ncommandA | commandB       Pipe stdout of commandA to commandB\ncommandA | tee filename   Pipe stdout of commandA into filename AND stdout\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRedirection explained further\n\n\n\n\n\nThis section was adapted from (“Illustrated Redirection Tutorial [Bash Hackers Wiki]” 2023)\n\n4.1 Output Redirection n&gt; file\n&gt; is probably the simplest redirection.\necho foo &gt; file\nthe &gt; file after the command alters the file descriptors belonging to the command echo. It changes the file descriptor 1 (&gt; file is the same as 1&gt;file) so that it points to the file file. They will look like:\n                  ---       +-----------------------+\nstandard input   ( 0 ) ----&gt;| /dev/pts/5            |\n                  ---       +-----------------------+\n\n                  ---       +-----------------------+\nstandard output  ( 1 ) ----&gt;| file                  |\n                  ---       +-----------------------+\n\n                  ---       +-----------------------+\nstandard error   ( 2 ) ----&gt;| /dev/pts/5            |\n                  ---       +-----------------------+\nNow characters written by our command, echo, that are sent to the standard output, i.e., the file descriptor 1, end up in the file named file.\nIn the same way, command 2&gt; file will change the standard error and will make it point to file. For example, command 2&gt; /dev/null will delete all errors outputted by command:\n                  ---       +-----------------------+\nstandard input   ( 0 ) ----&gt;| /dev/pts/5            |\n                  ---       +-----------------------+\n\n                  ---       +-----------------------+\nstandard output  ( 1 ) ----&gt;| /dev/pts/5            |\n                  ---       +-----------------------+\n\n                  ---       +-----------------------+\nstandard error   ( 2 ) ----&gt;| /dev/null             |\n                  ---       +-----------------------+\n\n\n4.2 Input Redirection n&lt; file\nWhen you run a command using command &lt; file, it changes the file descriptor 0 so that it looks like:\n                  ---       +-----------------------+\nstandard input   ( 0 ) &lt;----| file                  |\n                  ---       +-----------------------+\n\n                  ---       +-----------------------+\nstandard output  ( 1 ) ----&gt;| /dev/pts/5            |\n                  ---       +-----------------------+\n\n                  ---       +-----------------------+\nstandard error   ( 2 ) ----&gt;| /dev/pts/5            |\n                  ---       +-----------------------+\nIf the command reads from stdin, it now will read from file and not from the console.\n\n\n4.3 Pipes |\nWhat does this | do? Among other things, it connects the standard output of the command on the left to the standard input of the command on the right. That is, it creates a special file, a pipe, which is opened as a write destination for the left command, and as a read source for the right command.\ncommand:   echo foo               |                cat\n\n ---       +--------------+               ---       +--------------+\n( 0 ) ----&gt;| /dev/pts/5   |     ------&gt;  ( 0 ) ----&gt;|pipe (read)   |\n ---       +--------------+    /          ---       +--------------+\n                              /\n ---       +--------------+  /            ---       +--------------+\n( 1 ) ----&gt;| pipe (write) | /            ( 1 ) ----&gt;| /dev/pts     |\n ---       +--------------+               ---       +--------------+\n\n ---       +--------------+               ---       +--------------+\n( 2 ) ----&gt;| /dev/pts/5   |              ( 2 ) ----&gt;| /dev/pts/    |\n ---       +--------------+               ---       +--------------+\nThis is possible because the redirections are set up by the shell before the commands are executed, and the commands inherit the file descriptors."

It is intended to provide secure encrypted communications between two untrusted hosts over an insecure network.\nssh connects and logs into the specified destination, which may be specified as either [user@]hostname or a URI of the form ssh://[user@]hostname[:port].\nIf a command is specified, it will be executed on the remote host instead of a login shell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nssh details & examples\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere’s nothing here yet… stay tuned!\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 rsync\n\nNAME\n  rsync - a fast, versatile, remote (and local) file-copying tool\n\nSYNOPSIS\n  Local:\n    rsync [OPTION...] SRC... [DEST]\n  Access via remote shell:\n    Pull:\n        rsync [OPTION...] [USER@]HOST:SRC... [DEST]\n    Push:\n        rsync [OPTION...] SRC... [USER@]HOST:DEST\n\nRsync is a fast and extraordinarily versatile file copying tool. It can copy locally, to/from another host over any remote shell, or to/from a remote rsync daemon.\nIt is famous for sending only the differences between the source files and the existing files in the destination, increasing efficiency for repetitive synchronization between source and destination.\nRsync is widely used for backups and mirroring, and as an improved cp command for everyday use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrsync details & examples\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere’s nothing here yet… stay tuned!\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 tar, zip, and unzip\n\nNAME\n  tar - a general archiving utility for creation/extraction/compression and more\n  zip - package and compress files into a ZIP archive\n  unzip - list, test and extract compressed files from a ZIP archive\n\nSYNOPSIS\n  tar --create/--extract [--file ARCHIVE] [OPTIONS] [FILE...]\n  zip [OPTIONS] [ARCHIVE] [FILE...]\n  unzip [ARCHIVE] [-d OUTPUTDIR]\n\nThe tar, zip, and unzip programs provide the ability to create, extract, and otherwise manipulate archives of files, where an archive of files is simply a file that stores a collection of other files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntar, zip, and unzip details & examples\n\n\n\n\n\nThis section was adapted from (“GNU Tar 1.35: 2 Tutorial Introduction to Tar” n.d.).\nThe specific usecases for tar/zip/unzip are similar but vary slightly.\nAll three tools are used for efficient storage, transfer, and backup of collections of files, particularly large files via compression.\n\ntar:\n\ndefault: create/extract an uncompressed archive (.tar) of a collection of files\nwith --gzip/-z: create/extract a compressed archive (.tar.gz) of a collection of files\nwith --bzip2/-j: create/extract a compressed archive (.tar.bz2) of a collection of files\n\nzip:\n\ncreate a compressed collection of files (.zip)\n\nunzip:\n\nextract a compressed collection of files (.zip)\n\n\n\n5.3.1 Operations\nThere are two main operations of interest for archiving programs:\n\ncreate: create a new archive (.zip, .tar, .tar.gz, tar.bz2)\nextract: extract the files of an archive to a directory\n\nExamples of each follow below:\n\nCreateExtract\n\n\n# Assume you have a directory called music/ and three folders inside it:\n$ tree music\nmusic/\n├── blues\n│   └── nina-simone\n├── folk\n│   └── phil-ochs\n└── jazz\n    └── charles-mingus\n\n# Create an uncompressed archive (.tar) of all three files\n$ tar --create --file=collection.tar music\n\n# Creates a compressed archive (.zip, .tar.gz, .tar.bz2)\n$ zip -r collection.zip music\n$ tar --create --gzip --file=collection.tar.gz music\n$ tar --create --bzip2 --file=collection.tar.bz2 music\n\n# tar has shorthand versions of the above parameters\n$ tar -c -f collection.tar music\n$ tar -c -z -f collection.tar.gz music\n$ tar -cjf collection.tar.bz2 music\n\n\n\n# Assume you have the archives from the Create example:\n$ tar --list collection.tar\nmusic/\n├── blues\n│   └── nina-simone\n├── folk\n│   └── phil-ochs\n└── jazz\n    └── charles-mingus\n\n# Extract all files from an uncompressed archive (.tar) to the current directory\n$ tar --extract --file=collection.tar\n\n# Extract all files from a compressed archive (.zip, .tar.gz, .tar.bz2) to the current directory\n$ unzip collection.zip\n$ tar --extract --gzip --file=collection.tar.gz\n$ tar --extract --bzip2 --file=collection.tar.bz2\n\n# Extract all files from a compressed archive, specifying a different output directory\n$ unzip collection.zip -d ~/some-folder\n$ tar --extract --gzip --file=collection.tar.gz --directory ~/music\n$ tar --extract --bzip2 --file=collection.tar.bz2 --directory /tmp/music\n\n# tar has shorthand versions of the above parameters\n$ tar -x -f collection.tar\n$ tar -x -z -f collection.tar.gz -C ~/music\n$ tar -xjf collection.tar.bz2 -C /tmp/music\n\n\n\nEach of these operations is mutually exclusive, which makes some sense. You cannot create and extract an archive at the same time, that doesn’t make sense!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWhen using --create or -c, tar will overwrite current contents of the file named by -f. To add files to an existing archive, you need to use --append or -r.\n\nYou can read more:\n\nthe usecases and history of tar at (gnu.org)\nA helpful comparison between tar and zip (stackoverflow)\nA reallyy thorough breakdown of compression in tar and zip (stackoverflow)\n\n\n\n5.4 git\n\nNAME\n  git - the stupid content tracker\n\nSYNOPSIS\n  git &lt;command&gt; [&lt;args&gt;]\n\nGit is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals.\nSee man 7 gittutorial to get started, then see man 7 giteveryday for a useful minimum set of commands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngit details & examples\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere’s nothing here yet… stay tuned!"
