If you start python as root, sys.path might have different paths.\n\nBelow, python was started as root:\npi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo -i\nroot@raspberrypi:~# python3\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; import sys\n&gt;&gt;&gt; sys.path\n[\n'',\n'/usr/lib/python37.zip',\n'/usr/lib/python3.7',\n'/usr/lib/python3.7/lib-dynload',\n'/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages',\n'/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages'\n]\nNote that the user pi does not have permission to add content inside /usr. Thus, all pip installations as the regular user go into /home/pi/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages.\nConclusion: if you install a python library as root, it might go to a different directory compared to installing it as the regular user.\nThis is the main reason why we chose to install the seeed-python-reterminal as root, rather than the regular user pi.\n\n\n\nMaking user’s library available to root (optional)\nIf you would like to make a library installed as the user pi available when running the script as root, you will need to export an environmental variable named PYTHONPATH pointing to the library location.\nFor example, assuming that a library installed under the user pi is located in /home/pi/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages, do the following:\n# Elevate the shell to the root user\npi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo -i\nroot@raspberrypi:~#\n\n# Export the PYTHONPATH environment variable\nroot@raspberrypi:~# export PYTHONPATH=\"/home/pi/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages\"\n\n# Start python as root and run the script that imports the library\nroot@raspberrypi:~# python3 my_script.py\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

    "text": "Apt: Debian Package Manger\nThe command apt is the default package manager of Debian.\n\nA package manager is a software tool responsible for automating the installation, removal, configuration and removal of computer programs.\n\nManaging packages could technically be done manually, however, it is very time consuming and error prone: tracking package dependencies and compatibility with the current system.\n\nCommon apt commands\nThere are many apt commands you will find yourself using all the time on a Debian-based OS like Raspberry Pi. It’s worth knowing in a bit more detail how they work.\nNote: Online, you will often see apt-get used instead of apt. apt is a newer package manager API meant to replace the older API apt-get. However, they both do more or less the same things the same ways, and apt is a backwards compatible replacement for apt-get in all cases. See Debian docs for details.\nDuring Lab 1, you updated, upgraded and installed some packages in the Raspberry Pi OS using apt:\n\napt: the difference between update and upgrade\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommand\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nsudo apt update\nUpdate list of available packages\n\n\nsudo apt upgrade\nUpgrade the system by installing/upgrading packages\n\n\n\nCombined, these two commands update and upgrade all of the currently operating system packages on your system:\n$ sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y\nThere are a few other apt commands worth knowing.\n\napt: a variety of other commands I find myself using now and again\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommand\nDescription\nExample use case\n\n\n\n\napt list\nlist packages installed on your system based on package names.\napt list | grep \"package name\" Need to remember or check if you successfully installed an app? Combine apt list with grep and a pipe.\n\n\napt search &lt;query&gt;\nReturns all repository packages search in package descriptions\napt search \"package name\" Do you know part of the? Run after apt\n\n\napt show &lt;package&gt;\nshow package details\n\n\n\napt install &lt;package&gt;\ninstall packages\n\n\n\napt reinstall &lt;package&gt;\nreinstall packages\n\n\n\napt remove &lt;package&gt;\nremove packages\n\n\n\n\nYou can see details about all of these commands and more by running apt --help. Note: documentation will often leave out sudo since the need to run sudo depends on the machine and the user.\n\nIn general, commands that read data (apt list, apt search, etc.) will generally not require sudo, since most folderst that apt will touch are universally readable.\napt commands that write data (apt install, etc.) to a folder not owned by the current user – which is most folders outside of /home/username, but particularly common package install locations like /usr, /bin, etc. – these commands will require sudo to gain the required write permission\n\n\n\nApt source repositories explained\nThis section has been adapted directly from the Debian documentation: see SourcesList\nApt downloads packages from one or more software repositories (sources) and installs them onto your computer.\nA repository is generally a network server, such as the official DebianStable repository. Local directories or CD/DVD are also accepted.\nThe specific repositories (package sources) configured on your machine affect: - What software packages are available for download - What versions of packages are available - Who packages the software\n\nCommonly used package sources\n\nDebianStable: official Debian repository for the current release\nStableProposedUpdates: official Debian repository for upcoming point releases (security and important bug fixes every ~2 months)\nStableUpdates: official Debian repository for changes that cannot wait for the next point release, packages are also added to StableProposedUpdates for inclusion in the next point release\nDebianSecurity: official Debian repository for frequent security updates\nDebianBackports: more recent versions of some packages, compatible with DebianStable.\nDebianUnstable: rolling development version containing the latest packages\nDebianExperimental: development version containing the experimental/alpha/beta/untested packages\n\n\n\nEditing Software Sources\nBeing able to change the repositories used by your package management system is a powerful feature but this power comes with some responsibility.\nUsers are cautioned that it is possible to break your system (in a way that could be difficult or impossible to cleanly fix) by adding third-party repositories, or repositories for a Debian version that does not match your current version - these repository create a risk of conflicting package versions, creating what’s sometimes called a “Franken-Debian” system.\nThe whole concept behind a Debian stable release is that the Debian developers have picked a set of software and their versions that function nicely together. While this software is patched to fix security issues, the software is frequently not the latest version. It takes some experience to know how the repos may be changed without risk of breaking your system. Users of all levels are advised to change repos cautiously.",

These include:\n\nDesktop distributions like Ubuntu, Linux Mint, elementaryOS;\nSpecial-purpose distributions Kali Linux and Backbox (penetration testing)\nServer/Hypervisor distributions like Proxmox, Ubuntu server,\nMany others, you can find a more complete list here\n\n\nDebian-derived distributions share the following: - the .deb package format - the dpkg package manager and its frontend apt\nFor that reason, many of the commands and configuration for Raspberry Pi OS can be taken directly from Debian’s documentation."

    "section": "Apt: Debian Package Manger",
    "text": "Apt: Debian Package Manger\nThe command apt is the default package manager of Debian.\n\nA package manager is a software tool responsible for automating the installation, removal, configuration and removal of computer programs.\n\nManaging packages could technically be done manually, however, it is very time consuming and error prone: tracking package dependencies and compatibility with the current system.\nCommon apt commands\nThere are many apt commands you will find yourself using all the time on a Debian-based OS like Raspberry Pi. It’s worth knowing in a bit more detail how they work.\nNote: Online, you will often see apt-get used instead of apt. apt is a newer package manager API meant to replace the older API apt-get. However, they both do more or less the same things the same ways, and apt is a backwards compatible replacement for apt-get in all cases. See Debian docs for details.\nDuring Lab 1, you updated, upgraded and installed some packages in the Raspberry Pi OS using apt:\n\napt: the difference between update and upgrade\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommand\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nsudo apt update\nUpdate list of available packages\n\n\nsudo apt upgrade\nUpgrade the system by installing/upgrading packages\n\n\n\nCombined, these two commands update and upgrade all of the currently operating system packages on your system:\n$ sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y\nThere are a few other apt commands worth knowing.\n\napt: a variety of other commands I find myself using now and again\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommand\nDescription\nExample use case\n\n\n\n\napt list\nlist packages installed on your system based on package names.\napt list | grep \"package name\" Need to remember or check if you successfully installed an app? Combine apt list with grep and a pipe.\n\n\napt search &lt;query&gt;\nReturns all repository packages search in package descriptions\napt search \"package name\" Do you know part of the? Run after apt\n\n\napt show &lt;package&gt;\nshow package details\n\n\n\napt install &lt;package&gt;\ninstall packages\n\n\n\napt reinstall &lt;package&gt;\nreinstall packages\n\n\n\napt remove &lt;package&gt;\nremove packages\n\n\n\n\nYou can see details about all of these commands and more by running apt --help. Note: documentation will often leave out sudo since the need to run sudo depends on the machine and the user.\n\nIn general, commands that read data (apt list, apt search, etc.) will generally not require sudo, since most folderst that apt will touch are universally readable.\napt commands that write data (apt install, etc.) to a folder not owned by the current user – which is most folders outside of /home/username, but particularly common package install locations like /usr, /bin, etc. – these commands will require sudo to gain the required write permission\n\nApt source repositories explained\nThis section has been adapted directly from the Debian documentation: see SourcesList\nApt downloads packages from one or more software repositories (sources) and installs them onto your computer.\nA repository is generally a network server, such as the official DebianStable repository. Local directories or CD/DVD are also accepted.\nThe specific repositories (package sources) configured on your machine affect: - What software packages are available for download - What versions of packages are available - Who packages the software\nCommonly used package sources\n\nDebianStable: official Debian repository for the current release\nStableProposedUpdates: official Debian repository for upcoming point releases (security and important bug fixes every ~2 months)\nStableUpdates: official Debian repository for changes that cannot wait for the next point release, packages are also added to StableProposedUpdates for inclusion in the next point release\nDebianSecurity: official Debian repository for frequent security updates\nDebianBackports: more recent versions of some packages, compatible with DebianStable.\nDebianUnstable: rolling development version containing the latest packages\nDebianExperimental: development version containing the experimental/alpha/beta/untested packages\n\nEditing Software Sources\nBeing able to change the repositories used by your package management system is a powerful feature but this power comes with some responsibility.\nUsers are cautioned that it is possible to break your system (in a way that could be difficult or impossible to cleanly fix) by adding third-party repositories, or repositories for a Debian version that does not match your current version - these repository create a risk of conflicting package versions, creating what’s sometimes called a “Franken-Debian” system.\nThe whole concept behind a Debian stable release is that the Debian developers have picked a set of software and their versions that function nicely together. While this software is patched to fix security issues, the software is frequently not the latest version. It takes some experience to know how the repos may be changed without risk of breaking your system. Users of all levels are advised to change repos cautiously."

Use ls -al to list the files in this directory:\nusername@hostname:/sys/class/leds/usr_led0 $ ls -al\ntotal 0            \ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root    0 Jan 25 20:33 .               \ndrwxr-xr-x 8 root root    0 Jan 25 20:33 ..                                                                                                                                                                         \n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4096 Jan 26 22:02 brightness                                                                                                                                                                 \n\n\n\nUnix Permissions cheatsheet by Julia Evans\n\n\nThe brightness file inide the usr_led0 controls the brightness of LED0. But, because only root has write permissions to this file, we will likely run into permissions errors if we try to edit the value directly:\n$ nano /sys/class/leds/usr_led0/brightness\nPermission denied\n\n$ echo 255 &gt; /sys/class/leds/usr_led0/brightness\nPermission denied\n\n$ sudo echo 255 &gt; /sys/class/leds/usr_led0/brightness\nPermission denied\nThere are a few possible approaches to this problem:\nUse sudo + text-editor\nYou can open a text-editor with root permissions using sudo:\n# nano text editor\nsudo nano /sys/class/leds/usr_led0/brightness\n\n# or, you can use vi/vim text editor\nsudo vi /sys/class/leds/usr_led0/brightness\nEdit the brightness file to a value between 0-255 using the editor. When you save, you should see the change immediately.\nUse sudo + su\nUsing an editor is perfectly reasonable for a one-off change, but annoying if you want to make the change more often.\nWe can use the echo value &gt; /path/to/file pattern, but only if we have permissions to write to /path/to/file – we can obtain these permissions if we run the entire command as the root user.\n\nNOTE: Running commands as the root user can have unintended consequences, ranging from annoying/tedious to fix, to completely devastating/permanently ruinous for your machine. You should avoid being root wherever possible (see Use sudo + tee section below for how to avoid it for this problem).\n\nYou can enter a root shell instance using the command su (switch user), or by using sudo -i or sudo -s:\nuser@hostname $ sudo su\nroot@hostname # \n\nuser@hostname $ sudo -i\nroot@hostname # \n\nuser@hostname $ sudo -s\nroot@hostname # \nYour shell should now display root@hostname:~#.\nTurn on the LED with maximum brightness\n# echo 255 &gt; brightness\nTurn off the LED\n# echo 0 &gt; brightness\nSimilarly, you can control usr_led1 and usr_led2 and even the buzzer on /sys/class/leds/usr_buzzer\nWhen done working as root, you can exit the root shell and return to your user shell using the exit command (or Ctrl-D as a hotkey):\nroot@hostname # exit\nuser@hostname $\nUse sudo + tee\nIf we want to avoid using a text editor, AND avoid logging into a root shell instance, it would be great if something like this worked:\n$ sudo echo 255 &gt; /sys/class/leds/usr_led0/brightness\nBut it doesn’t! Can you understand why? Consider which part of the instruction sudo applies to. Unfortunately, there is no way to sudo &gt; or sudo filename since sudo executes commands as the root user, NOT filenames/redirects.\nWhat if there were a command that we could put after the redirect, and sudo that command? What would that command need to do? It’s time to introduce a “new” command: tee.\nTo be clear, tee is a 50 year old program and an absolute classic – it is as ubiquitous/essential as the other OG unix programs like ls, cat, echo. We will see why in the following example.\nTry running man tee in your reTerminal. You should see something like the following:\nTEE(1)\n\nNAME\n       tee - read from standard input and write to standard output and files\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       tee [OPTION]... [FILE]...\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       Copy standard input to each FILE, and also to standard output.\nWe have here a command that will read from standard input, and write that same content from standard input into BOTH standard output AND files – the files we can specify as arguments.\nChallenge for Lab 2: where would you put tee and sudo in the command below, to fix our permissions problems?\n$ echo 255 | /sys/class/leds/usr-led0/brightness \n# this command is missing `tee` and `sudo`.... find where to put them, and you've learned a very important unix pattern!\nLuminosity Sensor\nThe digital light sensor can read the surrounding light levels.\n\nEnter the following directory\n\ncd /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device0\n\nRead the following file to obtain the light intensity value in Lux\n\ncat in_illuminance_input \nOutput:\npi@raspberrypi:/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device0 $ cat in_illuminance_input \n2719\nNote: We don’t need to be root to read this file. Its permissions are set to let all users read it, even-though it belongs to the root user:\nrw-r--r-- 1 root root 4096 Jan 30 22:16 in_illuminance_input"

But, because only root has write permissions to this file, we will likely run into permissions errors if we try to edit the value directly:\n$ nano /sys/class/leds/usr_led0/brightness\nPermission denied\n\n$ echo 255 &gt; /sys/class/leds/usr_led0/brightness\nPermission denied\n\n$ sudo echo 255 &gt; /sys/class/leds/usr_led0/brightness\nPermission denied\nThere are a few possible approaches to this problem:\n\nUse sudo + text-editor\nYou can open a text-editor with root permissions using sudo:\n# nano text editor\nsudo nano /sys/class/leds/usr_led0/brightness\n\n# or, you can use vi/vim text editor\nsudo vi /sys/class/leds/usr_led0/brightness\nEdit the brightness file to a value between 0-255 using the editor. When you save, you should see the change immediately.\n\n\nUse sudo + su\nUsing an editor is perfectly reasonable for a one-off change, but annoying if you want to make the change more often.\nWe can use the echo value &gt; /path/to/file pattern, but only if we have permissions to write to /path/to/file – we can obtain these permissions if we run the entire command as the root user.\n\nNOTE: Running commands as the root user can have unintended consequences, ranging from annoying/tedious to fix, to completely devastating/permanently ruinous for your machine. You should avoid being root wherever possible (see Use sudo + tee section below for how to avoid it for this problem).\n\nYou can enter a root shell instance using the command su (switch user), or by using sudo -i or sudo -s:\nuser@hostname $ sudo su\nroot@hostname # \n\nuser@hostname $ sudo -i\nroot@hostname # \n\nuser@hostname $ sudo -s\nroot@hostname # \nYour shell should now display root@hostname:~#.\nTurn on the LED with maximum brightness\n# echo 255 &gt; brightness\nTurn off the LED\n# echo 0 &gt; brightness\nSimilarly, you can control usr_led1 and usr_led2 and even the buzzer on /sys/class/leds/usr_buzzer\nWhen done working as root, you can exit the root shell and return to your user shell using the exit command (or Ctrl-D as a hotkey):\nroot@hostname # exit\nuser@hostname $\n\n\nUse sudo + tee\nIf we want to avoid using a text editor, AND avoid logging into a root shell instance, it would be great if something like this worked:\n$ sudo echo 255 &gt; /sys/class/leds/usr_led0/brightness\nBut it doesn’t! Can you understand why? Consider which part of the instruction sudo applies to. Unfortunately, there is no way to sudo &gt; or sudo filename since sudo executes commands as the root user, NOT filenames/redirects.\nWhat if there were a command that we could put after the redirect, and sudo that command? What would that command need to do? It’s time to introduce a “new” command: tee.\nTo be clear, tee is a 50 year old program and an absolute classic – it is as ubiquitous/essential as the other OG unix programs like ls, cat, echo. We will see why in the following example.\nTry running man tee in your reTerminal. You should see something like the following:\nTEE(1)\n\nNAME\n       tee - read from standard input and write to standard output and files\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       tee [OPTION]... [FILE]...\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       Copy standard input to each FILE, and also to standard output.\nWe have here a command that will read from standard input, and write that same content from standard input into BOTH standard output AND files – the files we can specify as arguments.\nChallenge for Lab 2: where would you put tee and sudo in the command below, to fix our permissions problems?\n$ echo 255 | /sys/class/leds/usr-led0/brightness \n# this command is missing `tee` and `sudo`.... find where to put them, and you've learned a very important unix pattern!\n\n\nLuminosity Sensor\nThe digital light sensor can read the surrounding light levels.\n\nEnter the following directory\n\ncd /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device0\n\nRead the following file to obtain the light intensity value in Lux\n\ncat in_illuminance_input \nOutput:\npi@raspberrypi:/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device0 $ cat in_illuminance_input \n2719\nNote: We don’t need to be root to read this file. Its permissions are set to let all users read it, even-though it belongs to the root user:\nrw-r--r-- 1 root root 4096 Jan 30 22:16 in_illuminance_input",
