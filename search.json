Use ls -al to list the files in this directory:\nusername@hostname:/sys/class/leds/usr_led0 $ ls -al\ntotal 0            \ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root    0 Jan 25 20:33 .               \ndrwxr-xr-x 8 root root    0 Jan 25 20:33 ..                                                                                                                                                                         \n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4096 Jan 26 22:02 brightness                                                                                                                                                                 \n\n\n\nUnix Permissions cheatsheet by Julia Evans\n\n\nThe brightness file inide the usr_led0 controls the brightness of LED0. But, because only root has write permissions to this file, we will likely run into permissions errors if we try to edit the value directly:\n$ nano /sys/class/leds/usr_led0/brightness\nPermission denied\n\n$ echo 255 &gt; /sys/class/leds/usr_led0/brightness\nPermission denied\n\n$ sudo echo 255 &gt; /sys/class/leds/usr_led0/brightness\nPermission denied\nThere are a few possible approaches to this problem:\nUse sudo + text-editor\nYou can open a text-editor with root permissions using sudo:\n# nano text editor\nsudo nano /sys/class/leds/usr_led0/brightness\n\n# or, you can use vi/vim text editor\nsudo vi /sys/class/leds/usr_led0/brightness\nEdit the brightness file to a value between 0-255 using the editor. When you save, you should see the change immediately.\nUse sudo + su\nUsing an editor is perfectly reasonable for a one-off change, but annoying if you want to make the change more often.\nWe can use the echo value &gt; /path/to/file pattern, but only if we have permissions to write to /path/to/file – we can obtain these permissions if we run the entire command as the root user.\n\nNOTE: Running commands as the root user can have unintended consequences, ranging from annoying/tedious to fix, to completely devastating/permanently ruinous for your machine. You should avoid being root wherever possible (see Use sudo + tee section below for how to avoid it for this problem).\n\nYou can enter a root shell instance using the command su (switch user), or by using sudo -i or sudo -s:\nuser@hostname $ sudo su\nroot@hostname # \n\nuser@hostname $ sudo -i\nroot@hostname # \n\nuser@hostname $ sudo -s\nroot@hostname # \nYour shell should now display root@hostname:~#.\nTurn on the LED with maximum brightness\n# echo 255 &gt; brightness\nTurn off the LED\n# echo 0 &gt; brightness\nSimilarly, you can control usr_led1 and usr_led2 and even the buzzer on /sys/class/leds/usr_buzzer\nWhen done working as root, you can exit the root shell and return to your user shell using the exit command (or Ctrl-D as a hotkey):\nroot@hostname # exit\nuser@hostname $\nUse sudo + tee\nIf we want to avoid using a text editor, AND avoid logging into a root shell instance, it would be great if something like this worked:\n$ sudo echo 255 &gt; /sys/class/leds/usr_led0/brightness\nBut it doesn’t! Can you understand why? Consider which part of the instruction sudo applies to. Unfortunately, there is no way to sudo &gt; or sudo filename since sudo executes commands as the root user, NOT filenames/redirects.\nWhat if there were a command that we could put after the redirect, and sudo that command? What would that command need to do? It’s time to introduce a “new” command: tee.\nTo be clear, tee is a 50 year old program and an absolute classic – it is as ubiquitous/essential as the other OG unix programs like ls, cat, echo. We will see why in the following example.\nTry running man tee in your reTerminal. You should see something like the following:\nTEE(1)\n\nNAME\n       tee - read from standard input and write to standard output and files\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       tee [OPTION]... [FILE]...\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       Copy standard input to each FILE, and also to standard output.\nWe have here a command that will read from standard input, and write that same content from standard input into BOTH standard output AND files – the files we can specify as arguments.\nChallenge for Lab 2: where would you put tee and sudo in the command below, to fix our permissions problems?\n$ echo 255 | /sys/class/leds/usr-led0/brightness \n# this command is missing `tee` and `sudo`.... find where to put them, and you've learned a very important unix pattern!\nLuminosity Sensor\nThe digital light sensor can read the surrounding light levels.\n\nEnter the following directory\n\ncd /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device0\n\nRead the following file to obtain the light intensity value in Lux\n\ncat in_illuminance_input \nOutput:\npi@raspberrypi:/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device0 $ cat in_illuminance_input \n2719\nNote: We don’t need to be root to read this file. Its permissions are set to let all users read it, even-though it belongs to the root user:\nrw-r--r-- 1 root root 4096 Jan 30 22:16 in_illuminance_input"
