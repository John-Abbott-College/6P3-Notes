A few students have run into system updates that may break important reTerminal features (the screen, for e.g.). If you run into any issues when updating your pi software, see below!

The standard Debian commands for updating system software: 

```bash
$ sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

The latest linux updates have [introduced some significant changes to i2c interface](https://forum.seeedstudio.com/t/running-seeed-linux-dtoverlays-in-reterminal-fails-to-build-device-driver/275675) which may cause your pi LCD screen, among other hardware, to fail.

For now, when updating your pi software, you should also do the following:

```bash
# If this folder does not exist, run the following command first:
# cd ~/ && git clone https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/seeed-linux-dtoverlays
cd ~/seeed-linux-dtoverlays 
git pull
```

If there are any updates when the `git pull` is run, you should re-run the setup script:

```bash
sudo ./scripts/reTerminal.sh
```

Then, finally, reboot the device:

```bash
sudo reboot
```
