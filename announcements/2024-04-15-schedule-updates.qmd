I've made a series of updates to the course website and Moodle, some of which are worth emphasizing because I think they'll be particularly useful to you:

- [Course Calendar][calendar]: I've updated the **April** section of the calendar with the latest set of deliverables.
- **Final Project Description and Milestones**: I've uploaded all remaining Connected Objects Milestones onto Moodle. Links for [Section 1][project-sec1], [Section 2][project-sec2]
- [Lectures][lectures]: There are a new set of IoT lectures which should help you with Lab 6 (links for [Section 1][lab6-sec1], [Section 2][lab6-sec2]). We will also cover this ground on Assignment 2 (TBA) and future project milestones. This is the (almost) the final set of lectures for this class, and will be covered in Quiz 2.

Let me know if you have any questions, or if there's something that doesn't seem to work.
