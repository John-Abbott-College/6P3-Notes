- investigate code-overflow: wrap not taking effect in prod, but working in preview

- pi: 32->64 bit explanation
- quality of life changes to the pi (pimp my pi lab)
- adapt linux file system notes from Unix Networking lectures?

In class demo ideas

- mauricio has some py scripts that are probs worth checking out...

echo 5 | sudo tee brightness 

- (the reTerminal setup and sensors notes contain the above, let's say "overview of reterminal interfaces/hardware/capabilities/etc.?)

- lecture: scripting, bash, risks vs rewards, a practical approach (good for reading current state, very fast, native format, remembering steps, make alias, etc.)

- cool lab idea: sxkhd to have hotkey for brightness control. that would be fun
- then: download python library to do the same, introdouce the point of the rest of the circuitry
