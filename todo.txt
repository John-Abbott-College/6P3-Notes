- pi: 32->64 bit explanation
- any other quality of life changes to the pi to be made?
- led lab?
- adafruit notes?
- calendar?

- adapt linux file system notes from Unix Networking?

In class demo ideas

- mauricio has some py scripts that are probs worth checking out...


# https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Backlight
# https://man.archlinux.org/man/sysfs.5
- /sys/class/backlight/display-dir
display-dir depends on graphics card model (intel or ati or in this case pi)

echo 5 | sudo tee brightness 

- (the reTerminal setup and sensors notes contain the above, let's say "overview of reterminal interfaces/hardware/capabilities/etc.?)

progression: talk about the device, get 'em to think about how it works, get 'em to read some notes, do some demos of /sys/ etc. 

break, then talk about scripting, bash, risks vs rewards, a practical approach (good for reading current state, very fast, native format, remembering steps, make alias, etc.)

cool idea: sxkhd to have hotkey for brightness control?!?! that would be fun lol.

then: download python library to do the same, tease the point of the rest of the circuitry
