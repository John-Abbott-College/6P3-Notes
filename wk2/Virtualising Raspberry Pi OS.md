# Virtualizing the Raspberry Pi OS

Hello everyone. Tomorrow we will have a short lab where, we will create a virtual machine for the Raspberry Pi OS (for testing only).

To make the session smoother, please make sure you have two things before we start:
1. The image file for the **Raspberry Pi Desktop**. Official download [here](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/raspberry-pi-desktop/).
2. A virtualisation hypervisor of your choice. Some options:
	- **Virtual Box**. Download [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).
	- **Hyper-V** for Windows 10. Installation instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v).
	- [KVM](https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Downloads) with [virt-manager](https://virt-manager.org/) if you are on Linux.

Thank you.
