# Data Routing & Processing
## Data Analysis
### Azure Time Series Insight
[Azure Time Series Insights Gen2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/time-series-insights/overview-what-is-tsi) is an open and scalable end-to-end IoT analytics service.

You can use it to collect, process, store, query and visualize data at Internet of Things (IoT) scale--data that's highly contextualized and optimized for time series.


### Azure Stream Analytics

Stream Analytics is intended for **real-time data analysis**.

This service is intended for immediate data processing, before it is batched or stored. 

If real-time data is not required, consider something else.



## Visualizing Data

### Data Explorer
[Azure Data Explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/data-explorer-overview) is a big data analytics platform that makes it easy to analyze high volumes of data in near real time.

The Azure Data Explorer toolbox gives you an end-to-end solution for data ingestion, query, visualization, and management.

Data Explorer has its own Web UI Dashboard but can also connect to Grafana, Power BI, Excel, and others. See [here for details](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/viz-overview).

Below is a [solution example for IoT analytics with Data Explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/solution-ideas/articles/iot-azure-data-explorer).
