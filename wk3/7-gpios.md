# GPIOs: Inputs & Outputs


## Intro to Pi's GPIOs ðŸ¥§

The Raspberry Pi can read and generate digital signals using **General Purpose Input and Output (GPIO)** pins.

Any of the GPIO pins can be designated (in software) as an input or output pin and used for a wide range of purposes.

The reTerminal exposes the same 40-pin header as the Pi on it's side:

### Voltages

Two 5V pins and two 3V3 pins are present on the board, as well as a number of ground pins (0V), which are unconfigurable. The remaining pins are all general purpose 3V3 pins, meaning outputs are set to 3V3 and inputs are 3V3-tolerant.

### Outputs

A GPIO pin designated as an output pin can be set to high (3V3) or low (0V).

### Inputs

A GPIO pin designated as an input pin can be read as high (3V3) or low (0V).

**We will learn how to use the GPIOs in a future lesson.**

### Digital Communication Protocols

In addition to simple input and output devices, the GPIO pins can be used with a variety of alternative functions and digital communication protocols.

These digital communication protocols are:

- **PWM** (pulse-width modulation)
- **SPI** (serial peripheral interface)
- **I2C** (inter-integrated circuit)
- **Serial**
- **PCM** (pulse-code modulation)

Some digital functions are available on all pins, others on specific pins.


### Sorry, No Analog

> **The Raspberry Pi does not have an ADC.**

> In order to process analog electrical signals an external ADC must be used.


**Hat to the Rescue**

In this course we will use the integrate ADC of the [Grove Base Hat](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove_Base_Hat_for_Raspberry_Pi/) for the Raspberry Pi.

[Pi HATs](https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-raspberry-pi-hats) is the term for expansion boards for the Raspberry Pi.

> Seeed's [Grove Base Hat](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove_Base_Hat_for_Raspberry_Pi/) for the Raspberry Pi has **4 connectors with integrated ADC**.
> 
> Each ADC connector has **12-bit resolution**.

In addition to the 4 ADC connectors, the Base Hat also exposes the original 40-pin header and other digital connectors.
