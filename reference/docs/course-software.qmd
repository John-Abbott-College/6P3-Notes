## Required software

The operating system running inside the reTerminal is Raspberry Pi OS, which is based on
Debian Linux.

We will make use of the following tools:

- `bash` and `python` and related packaging tools
- `git` and related configuration
- a Unix shell and package manager for installing and managing dependencies compatible
    with RasperryPi OS
- (later this semester) Azure and GitHub CLI tools
- (later this semester) `.NET` for interfacing with the App Dev III code

We will achieve that in one of the following ways, depending on the computer you are
using:

- (on Windows computers such as the lab computers) by creating a Debian WSL container
- (on OS X computers) using `brew`
- (on Linux computers) using your system package manager.

See below for further instructions for each.

### Recommended: Linux WSL

If using a Windows machine (lab computers and/or personal) for this course, you will need
to set up Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

- [Install Debian on WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment)
    - [Choosing Debian as the Linux distribution](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows/wsl/install#change-the-default-linux-distribution-installed)
    - [Set up Windows Terminal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows/wsl/setup/environment#set-up-windows-terminal)
    - [Set up VS Code](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-vscode)
    - [Set up git](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-git)
- Install dependencies:

```bash
# Update system:
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
# Verify python version is >= 3.9: 
python3 --version
# Ensure pip is installed:
sudo apt install python3-pip
pip3 --version
```

### Recommended: VS Code

1. [Remote - SSH by Microsoft](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh):
    Open any folder on a remote machine using SSH and take advantage of VS Code's full
    feature set.
1. [Python language support extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
1. [Python formatter/linter extension (ruff)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=charliermarsh.ruff)
1. Setting up `git` credentials
    - Once you have set up `git` on your developer environment, VSCode will automatically pick up any `--global` configurations you have set
    - There remains one more important task: setting up VSCode to use your [github token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)

## Cloud

### Microsoft Azure

![Azure IoT Hub: Create Using Azure Portal | Build5Nines](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fi1.wp.com%2Fbuild5nines.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F12%2FAzure_IoT_Hub_Featured_Image.jpg%3Fresize%3D1080%252C675%26ssl%3D1&f=1&nofb=1 ":size=400")
:::

Microsoft Azure will be used as the main platform that will:

- Register and connect devices.
- Store and analyse data.
- Manage the security layer.
- Provide libraries (SDKs) that can easily be integrated into our code.
- For more information see
    [Azure IoT page](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/iot/).
