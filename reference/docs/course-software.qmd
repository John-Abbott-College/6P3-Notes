## OS Software

### Raspberry Pi OS

The operating system running inside the reTerminal is Raspberry Pi OS.

- Linux Debian based.
- Requires basic use of BASH shell (eg. ssh, and environmental variables).

### Recommended: Linux WSL

If using a Windows machine (lab computers and/or personal) for this course, you will need to set up Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

- [Install Debian on WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment)
  - [Choosing Debian as the Linux distribution](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows/wsl/install#change-the-default-linux-distribution-installed)
  - [Set up Windows Terminal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows/wsl/setup/environment#set-up-windows-terminal)
  - [Set up VS Code](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-vscode)
  - [Set up git](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-git)
- Install dependencies:

```bash
# Update system:
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
# Verify python version is >= 3.9: 
python3 --version
# Ensure pip is installed:
sudo apt install python3-pip
pip3 --version
```

Microsoft Azure will be used as the main platform that will:

- Register and connect devices.
- Store and analyse data.
- Manage the security layer.
- Provide libraries (SDKs) that can easily be integrated into our code.
- For more information see
