:::

The reTerminal requires a power supply that can provide a minimum of 3 Amps. The official
[Raspberry Pi USB-C Power Supply](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/type-c-power-supply/)
in included in the kit.

## Compute Module 4

:::

The
[Compute Module 4](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/compute-module-4/?variant=raspberry-pi-cm4001000)
(CM4) made by the Raspberry Pi Foundation is powering the reTerminal.

Notable features:

- Processor: Broadcom BCM2711 quad-core Cortex-A72 (ARM v8) 64-bit SoC @ 1.5GHz

> See [CM4 datasheet](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/cm4/cm4-datasheet.pdf) for
> details.

### Grove Base Hat for Raspberry Pi

:::{.column-margin}
![Grove Base Hat for GPIO connections](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove_Base_Hat_for_Raspberry_Pi/img/main.jpg ":size=300")
:::

In a typical Raspberry Pi, sensors would be connected via the 40-pin GPIO.

To facilitate connections of the Grove sensors, this "Hat" (term for an add-on board of
the Raspberry Pi) includes the following types of connection:

- 6 Digital
- 4 Analog
- 3 I2C
- 1 PWM
- 1 UART

> See [Grove base hat Wiki](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove_Base_Hat_for_Raspberry_Pi/)

## Sensors

### AHT20 I2C Temperature & Humidity

:::{.column-margin}
![AHT20 I2C temperature/humidity sensor](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove-AHT20_I2C_Industrial_Grade_Temperature_and_Humidity_Sensor/101990644_4_.png ":size=300")
:::

See
[AHT20 I2C Industrial Grade Temperature & Humidity Sensor wiki](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-AHT20-I2C-Industrial-Grade-Temperature&Humidity-Sensor/)
for details.

- Temperature measurement range -40 ~ 85Â°C, Humidity measurement range 0 ~ 100% RH.
- Digital output, Grove I2C interface.

### AHT20 Libraries

The main module for this sensor is provided by Seeed in
[this Github repository](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/grove.py/blob/master/grove/grove_temperature_humidity_aht20.py)
and can be installed with the `grove.py` library.

Follow official
[Step by step installation](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove_Base_Hat_for_Raspberry_Pi/#installation)
for python 3 (see below). Don't use the one-click installation or it will install to the
wrong location

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/grove.py](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/grove.py)
cd grove.py
sudo pip3 install .
```

Alternatively, it's also possible to use Adafruit's `adafruit-circuitpython-ahtx0` library
to communicate with the sensor (see
[library's Pypi page](https://pypi.org/project/adafruit-circuitpython-ahtx0/)). However,
to instantiate the provided sensor class, you will need to pass it an I2C bus instance. To
instantiate an I2C bus instance, install and use the `adafruit-extended-bus` library (see
[Pypi page](https://pypi.org/project/adafruit-extended-bus/)).
