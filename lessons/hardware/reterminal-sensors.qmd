## Lab 1 Review

After Lab 1, you have taken the following steps:

1. Install the Raspberry Pi OS image.
 - disassemble, flip the memory switch and use `usbboot/rpiboot` script to prepare internal memory for firmware flash.
 - use Raspberry Pi Imager to flash new image 64bit "Bookworm" Raspberry OS with chosen username/password and SSH enabled
 - fix the "black screen" issue by installing the latest seeed overlay drivers

2. Update system packages
 - update system repositories with `sudo apt update` and `sudo apt upgrade`
 - install kernel headers with `sudo apt install raspberrypi-kernel-headers`
 - install `git` and `docker`, deploy simple Python webserver docker container

3. Set up remote connection interfaces
 - determine your assigned IP address on the class LAN
 - determine your device MAC address
 - enable VNC interface

It's time to take a deeper look at the hardware and software our reTerminal offers.

## Hardware

*This section is adapted directly from the reTerminal wiki: ["Getting Started with reTerminal"](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/reTerminal/#features)*

The reTerminal is powered by a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 (CM4) which is
a Quad-Core Cortex-A72 CPU running at 1.5GHz and a 5-inch IPS capacitive
multi-touch screen with a resolution of 1280 x 720. It has sufficient
amount of RAM (4GB) to perform multitasking and also has sufficient
amount of eMMC storage (32GB) to install an operating system, enabling
fast boot up times and smooth overall experience. It has wireless
connectivity with dual-band 2.4GHz/5GHz Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 5.0 BLE.

reTerminal consists of a high-speed expansion interface and rich I/O for
more expandability. This device has security features such as a
cryptographic co-processor with secure hardware-based key storage. It
also has built-in modules such as an accelerometer, light sensor and an
RTC (Real-Time Clock). reTerminal has a Gigabit Ethernet Port for faster
network connections and also has dual USB 2.0 Type-A ports. The 40-pin
header on the reTerminal opens it for a wide range of IoT applications.

## Raspberry Pi OS

In Lab 1, we re-imaged the reTerminal Operating System to run the latest, recommended version of 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS. 

Raspberry Pi OS (previously called *Raspbian OS*) is a variation of the [**Debian OS**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian), with optimizations for the Raspberry Pi hardware.

You can see more about Raspberry Pi OS and Debian in the [Linux](/lessons/linux/package-management-debian.qmd) set of lessons.

## Reading sensor data in Linux

*This section is based on the official documentation for the reTerminal: [Hardware and Interfaces Usage](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/reTerminal-hardware-interfaces-usage/#3-user-programmable-leds)*

> In Linux, everything is a file stream that can be read and/or written to.

For example, keyboard inputs and communication over web-sockets are all read as a file streams.

The reTerminal has 3 programmable LED's and a light sensor that can be **controlled like a regular file**.

## Sensors

### Programmable LEDs

There are 3 programmable LEDs in the reTerminal:

- **STA** light can be turned on as **red or green**.
- **USR** light can only be turned on as **green**.

![](../assets/5-reterminal_leds.png ':size=400')

The lights can be controlled at the OS level by editing files in the `/sys/class/leds/` directory. Use `ls -al` to list the files in this directory:

```bash
username@hostname:/sys/class/leds/usr_led0 $ ls -al
total 0            
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root    0 Jan 25 20:33 .               
drwxr-xr-x 8 root root    0 Jan 25 20:33 ..                                                                                                                                                                         
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4096 Jan 26 22:02 brightness                                                                                                                                                                 
```

The `brightness` file inide the `usr_led0` controls the brightness of LED0. But, because only `root` has write permissions to this file, we will likely run into permissions errors if we try to edit the value directly:

```
$ nano /sys/class/leds/usr_led0
Permission denied
$ echo 255 > /sys/class/leds/usr_led0
Permission denied
$ sudo echo 255 > /sys/class/leds/usr_led0
```

There are a few possible approaches to this problem:

### Use sudo + text-editor

### Use sudo + su

Enable root account privileges (take the identity of the root user)

```bash
$ sudo su
```

Your shell should now display `root@hostname:~# `

Turn on the LED with maximum brightness

```bash
# echo 255 > brightness
```

Turn off the LED

```bash
# echo 0 > brightness
```

Similarly, you can control  `usr_led1` and `usr_led2` and even the buzzer on `/sys/class/leds/usr_buzzer`

### Use sudo + `tee`

**Note:** We'll run the next command as root because the file we want to write belongs the system (`root` user, rather than to the user `pi`.


### Luminosity Sensor

The digital light sensor can read the surrounding light levels.

1. Enter the following directory

```bash
cd /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device0
```

2. Read the following file to obtain the light intensity value in **Lux**

```bash
cat in_illuminance_input 
```

Output:
```bash
pi@raspberrypi:/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device0 $ cat in_illuminance_input 
2719
```

**Note:** We don't need to be root to read this file. Its permissions are set to let all users read it, even-though it belongs to the root user:

```bash
rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4096 Jan 30 22:16 in_illuminance_input
```

## Python Library for reTerminal

Seeed Studio provided a python library to access most of the sensors and actuators of the reTerminal.

Install the library `seeed-python-reterminal` (see official [Github repo](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Seeed_Python_ReTerminal)) using `pip`:

**NOTE:** See [Package Management in Python](/lessons/python/package-management-python.qmd) for a clear explanation of how to use `venv` and `pip`, particularly for [apps requiring root permissions](/lessons/python/package-management-python.qmd#root-permissions) 

```bash
pip install seeed-python-reterminal
```

Now you can import it to a test script (eg. *buzz.py*)

```python
import seeed_python_reterminal.core as rt
import time

print("BUZZER ON")
rt.buzzer = True
time.sleep(1)

print("BUZZER OFF")
rt.buzzer = False
```

This will sound the buzzer of the reTerminal for 1 second.

To run the script:
```bash
sudo $(which python) buzz.py
```

Alternatively, first elevate your shell, then execute the script normally:
```bash
user@hostname:~ $ sudo -i
root@hostname:~# python buzz.py
```
> **Note:** this library is simply a wrapper to the OS operations we did in the previous section.

See the official `seeed-python-reterminal` [Github repo](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Seeed_Python_ReTerminal) for API reference on how to control:

- LED's
- Accelerometer
- Programmable Buttons
- Light Sensor
