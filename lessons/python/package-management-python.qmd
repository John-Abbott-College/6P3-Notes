### Pip: Python Package Manager

[`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) is python's own package manager, which is independent from `apt`. 

> Pip installs packages from the [Python Package Index repository (pypi.org)](https://pypi.org/)

To use it for python 3, call the command `pip3`

```bash
pip3 install emoji
```

This will install the a python library emoji which will create emoji from text descriptions.

Once a python module has been installed, it is available to be imported in your python script:

```python
import emoji

message = emoji.emojize('Howdy :sun_with_face:')
print(message)
```

Output:

```bash
Howdy 🌞
```

It is also possible to give an alias to the newly imported module:

```python
import emoji as em

message = em.emojize('Howdy :sun_with_face:')
print(message)
```

Finally, you can import only a specific function and give it an alias:

```python
from emoji import emojize as emz
message = emz('Howdy :sun_with_face:')
print(message)
```

### apt vs pip: when to use which?

> Note: do not run `pip` as `sudo` because `pip` could overwrite system files that are managed by `apt`.

### ModuleNotFoundError

When trying to import the  `seeed-python-reterminal`  library, you might get the following error:

```bash
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'seeed_python_reterminal'
```

The python interpreter is not able to find the module even though it is installed.

You can run the checks described below.

#### Check library location

Check the location of where the module was installed with `pip3 show <module-name>`:

```bash
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ pip3 show seeed-python-reterminal

Name: seeed-python-reterminal
Version: 0.2
Summary: seeed-python-reterminal
Home-page: https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Seeed_Python_ReTerminal
Author: Takashi Matsuoka (matsujirushi)
Author-email: matsujirushi@live.jp
License: MIT License
Location: /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages      # Library location
Requires: evdev
Required-by: 
```

The library is installed at: `Location: /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages`


#### Check python's library paths

Similarly to Linux, there are environmental variables that determine where python will look for installed modules/libraries.

See the paths where python is looking for libraries with `sys.path`.

```python
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ python3

>>> import sys      # Exposes configuration used by the python interpreter.
>>> sys.path        # Lists all paths where interpreter looks for modules.
[
 '',
 '/usr/lib/python37.zip',
 '/usr/lib/python3.7',
 '/usr/lib/python3.7/lib-dynload',
 '/home/pi/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages',
 '/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages',
 '/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages'
]
```

If the output of `pip3 show seeed-python-reterminal` is not in this list, python will not find it when you import it.

> **Note:** the python shell above was started as the user `pi`.
> If you start python as **root**, `sys.path` might have different paths.

Below, python was started as **root**:

```python
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo -i
root@raspberrypi:~# python3

>>> import sys
>>> sys.path
[
'',
'/usr/lib/python37.zip',
'/usr/lib/python3.7',
'/usr/lib/python3.7/lib-dynload',
'/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages',
'/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages'
]
```

Note that the user `pi` does not have permission to add content inside `/usr`.
Thus, all `pip` installations as the regular user go into `/home/pi/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages`.

**Conclusion:** if you install a python library as `root`, it might go to a different directory compared to installing it as the regular user.

This is the main reason why we chose to install the `seeed-python-reterminal` as root, rather than the regular user `pi`.

### Making user's library available to root (optional)

If you would like to make a library installed as the user `pi` available when running the script as `root`, you will need to export an environmental variable named `PYTHONPATH` pointing to the library location.

For example, assuming that a library installed under the user `pi` is located in `/home/pi/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages`, do the following:

```bash
# Elevate the shell to the root user
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo -i
root@raspberrypi:~#

# Export the PYTHONPATH environment variable
root@raspberrypi:~# export PYTHONPATH="/home/pi/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages"

# Start python as root and run the script that imports the library
root@raspberrypi:~# python3 my_script.py
```
