## Description

This course will introduce students to the principles of the Internet of Things (IoT).
Students will use Linux and Python to program a Raspberry Pi in order to read data from sensors and control actuators.

By the end of the course, students build and deploy an IoT product that is securely connected to the Azure ecosystem in order to collect and analyse telemetry data as well as respond to remote commands.

## Requirements

- Experience using Object Oriented Programming to create applications in any language.
- Familiarity using the Bash shell and basic Linux CLI.
- Familiarity with Python.
- A Raspberry Pi with various sensors and actuators (see page [Hardware List](1-hardware-list.md)).
- A Microsoft Azure account (create a free [Azure for Students account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/) if necessary).
- VS Code configured for Python programming and remote development (see page [Dev Setup](1-vscode-python-setup.md)).
